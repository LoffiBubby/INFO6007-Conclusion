# Week 4 Case High-cost IT projects by Australian Govt #

There are currently 62 technology projects underway by Australian government entities that are valued at over AU$10 million and loosely under watch by the Digital Transformation Agency (DTA).
The DTA in early 2017 was charged with looking into the structures of existing Australian government high-cost technology projects, but as was revealed during a round of Senate Estimates last year, the DTA's powers only go so far and the best way to avoid scrutiny for a troubled IT project is to ignore phone calls from the DTA, not reply to emails, and bump up self-reported scores.
Documents received by ZDNet under freedom of information (FOI) revealed the earliest project the DTA is aware of started in April 2013 and has yet to be marked as completed.
The project in question, Department of Defence's Terrestrial Communications program, called JP 2047, was originally touted by the department as a multi-phased project to maintain and improve Defence's networked communications infrastructure.
Telstra was handed AU$1.1$ billion to build the network. A handful of million-dollar cash top-ups have since been paid, Austender shows.
The DTA previously said it was facilitating the exchange of information -- collaboration --
between other agencies and Defence for this project, with the DTA also engaging Defence to discuss lessons learnt from similar projects undertaken by the Commonwealth.
While the DTA has claimed section 33 protection under the FOI Act in providing information on seven projects, other Defence projects being monitored include an enterprise student management system. The Australian Defence Force (ADF) hopes to enhance the education and training of personnel, having handed Brisbane-based TechnologyOne a contract to deliver student management software in 2018.
After receiving nearly AU$1.4 million for the proof of concept, around AU$18 million was awarded in October.
Defence had also previously confirmed during Senate Estimates in October that it spent AU$7 million to procure an automated travel management system as part of Project Concur, which was ultimately abandoned. The final cost of this project exceeded a possible AU$10 million.
The travel management system was supposed to be completed by 2017.

## Week 4 IT project Cost ##

Average NSW government IT project blowouts are now 93 percent smaller than they were four years ago due in part to a whole-of-government assurance unit set up to end IT failures.
The ICT and digital assurance unit, which sits in the Department of Customer Service, was introduced in late 2016 alongside a strict new IT assurance framework to keep projects in check.
It followed a series of costly overruns on big IT projects like the now-infamous learning management and business reform (LMBR), which eventually came in at $755 million over 12 years. Under the framework, any project valued at $10 million or more, as well as those deemed of “strategic importance or concern”, is to be reviewed, with sign-off necessary before projects move forward.
That threshold has since been reduced to just $5 million or over, following the introduction of the digital restart fund - which was topped up with $1.6 billion last year - and the Delivery and Performance Committee (DaPCo) in 2019.
Data released by the ICT and assurance unit this week shows that since the framework that also compels mandatory check-ups to monitor the health of projects was introduced in 2017, large cost overruns in the state have all but evaporated.
According to analytics and insights senior manager Barnaby Waights, there have been no significant cost blowouts since the framework was introduced, with average cost overruns now 93 percent smaller.
“When we compare the projects that were transitioned into the [framework] in 2017 with the projects that started after, we can see that the typical cost overrun is 93 percent smaller,” he wrote in a blog post.
Projects found to come in over budget in recent years include TAFE’s new Oracle-based student management system and the Department of Justice and Communities’ Childstory overhaul.
The insight is the result of more than 160 project reviews, which have resulted in “nearly 2000 project recommendations” across all clusters.
In conducting its IT project reviews, the unit has witnessed average IT project costs fall by more 50 percent, while the average project size has also reduced by more than 30 percent.
“From 2017, we’ve seen the average project size reduce by one third across the ICT and digital project portfolio in NSW,” Waights said.
“Average project costs have declined 55 percent, from $72 million in 2017 to $40 million in 2020.”
While it’s difficult to get a true sense of the unit’s impact on the project cost and size due to changes in delivery methodology, Waights said the reduction was a “significant strategic achievement”.
“It means that projects are inherently less risky and tend to be delivered in smaller chunks, making them more manageable and easier to monitor,” he said.
The government recently moved to help this along by capping payments from the digital restart fund at $20 million, with further funding only to be provided when existing deliverables have been achieved.
Waights added that average project duration had also declined 17.5 percent, reducing the risk of technology becoming obsolete during a project’s lifetime

Q1: What are the issues with the Government-funded high-cost IT projects regarding project cost management?

1. Cost Overruns: Many government IT projects experienced significant cost overruns. An example given is the Learning Management and Business Reform (LMBR) project, which exceeded its budget by $755 million over 12 years.

2. Large Project Sizes: The projects were typically large in size, which increased their complexity and risk, and made them harder to manage and monitor.

3. Long Project Durations: The long duration of these projects increased the risk of technology becoming obsolete before the project was completed.

Q2: As an IT project manager, what would you like to recommend to improve the situation?

1. Implement an IT Assurance Framework: This framework should include mandatory check-ups to monitor the health of projects. Projects of a certain value or of strategic importance should be reviewed and signed off before they can proceed.

2. Lower the Threshold for Review: The threshold for review was reduced from $10 million to $5 million in NSW, which likely contributed to better control over projects.

3. Break Down Large Projects: By breaking down large projects into smaller, more manageable chunks, they become less risky and easier to monitor. This strategy also helps prevent technology from becoming obsolete before the project is completed.

4. Cap Funding: The NSW government capped payments from the digital restart fund at $20 million, with further funding only provided when existing deliverables have been achieved. This approach encourages better project management and accountability.

5. Establish a Dedicated Assurance Unit: The ICT and digital assurance unit in NSW played a key role in reducing cost overruns and project sizes. A similar unit could be beneficial in other contexts.

## Week 5  IT project budgets fall off the rails ##

Dubbed “Making It Work For You”, the $425 million project was meant to transform the information technology systems for the state's transport agencies.
But internal documents released under freedom of information laws show the major IT project for Transport for NSW has completed only a third of its end-user goals despite spending $348 million since it began almost five years ago.
A report from a consulting firm hired by Transport for NSW found last month (February 2018) that the IT service delivery team established in 2011 is facing substantial challenges including a lack of funds to deliver the capabilities to successfully function as a systems integrator.
A final report by Third Horizon marked “confidential” and “sensitive”, paints a worrying picture of the state of IT systems at Transport for NSW and the agencies which fall under its control such as Sydney Trains, bus operator State Transit and Roads and Maritime Services.
Financial benefits from centralising IT functions “are not being fully realised”, the service delivery performance appeared to be “worsening” and its credibility was declining. In a broad swipe,the report said the IT service delivery “does not appear to be meeting the service requirements” of the transport agencies, resulting in “significant broader impacts”.
Apart from factors such as “technical complexity”, it raised concerns about “governance issues” and took a shot at the “mindsets and behaviours” of those in the IT team that “hinder improvement”, warning that “major interventions” were needed to fix the situation.
And with the “Making It Work For You” project now scheduled to put in place “significant technical change”, the report dated February 19 this year (2018) warned of “large end-user impacts in the next four months”.
Greens transport spokeswoman, who obtained the report by using freedom of information laws, said the government needed to reveal whether the IT project would ever be completed and how much more public money would be wasted.
“This government has boasted about going digital but a project that wassupposed to deliver the most basic technology upgrade to one of its largest agencies has completely fallen through,” she said. “Ultimately, taxpayers bear the cost of their inability to deliver projects to budget and on time.”
Transport for NSW said in a statement that the IT project remained within the approved funding envelope and was “delivering against” a revised scope put in place in March 2017, which would be completed later this year.
The Third Horizon report does not mention the revised scope last year but has made a series of recommendations, including the need for “stronger leadership” and changes to the IT team's “structure and capacity”

Q1: What did you learn from the scenario about project cost management?

1. Cost Overruns: Despite spending $348 million, only a third of the project's end-user goals have been completed. This indicates a significant cost overrun and suggests that the project's cost was not managed effectively.

2. Lack of Funds: The IT service delivery team established for the project is facing a lack of funds to deliver the capabilities needed to function as a systems integrator. This suggests that the initial budget may have been underestimated, or funds were not allocated efficiently.

3. Financial Benefits Not Fully Realized: The financial benefits expected from centralizing IT functions were not fully realized. This could indicate that the cost savings anticipated from this approach were overestimated.

Q2: What did you learn from the scenario about project scope management?

1. Revised Scope: Transport for NSW stated that the IT project was "delivering against" a revised scope put in place in March 2017. This suggests that the initial project scope was not achievable or realistic, requiring adjustments partway through the project.

2. Governance Issues: The report raised concerns about governance issues, which could include problems with defining, communicating, and controlling the project's scope.

3. Significant End-User Impacts: The report warned of "large end-user impacts in the next four months", indicating that changes to the project's scope or implementation could have significant effects on the end users.

4. Need for Stronger Leadership and Structural Changes: The report recommended stronger leadership and changes to the IT team's structure and capacity. This could suggest that the project's scope was not managed effectively, possibly due to issues with leadership, team structure, or team capacity.

Q3: What did you learn about IT projects from the Transport for NSW agency site?

1. Large-Scale Infrastructure: Transport for NSW is involved in delivering infrastructure on a massive scale. This likely involves significant IT projects to support the planning, coordination, and execution of these infrastructure projects.

2. Innovation and Technology: The agency is committed to innovation and technology. This suggests that they are likely to be involved in IT projects that seek to leverage new technologies to improve transport services.

3. Customer Satisfaction: The agency conducts customer satisfaction surveys to gather feedback on public transport, roads, cycling, and walking. This could involve IT projects related to data collection, analysis, and reporting.

4. Featured Projects: The website mentions several featured projects, such as "Fixing Country Rail" and "Lower Hunter Freight Corridor". While it's not explicitly stated, these projects likely involve IT components for things like project management, data analysis, and possibly even systems to control and monitor the transport infrastructure.

5. Careers at Transport: The agency mentions that they are a workforce of over 25,000 people working across a diverse range of areas. This suggests that they likely have a substantial IT department to support their operations.

6. Transport Access Program: This program aims to provide a better experience for public transport customers by delivering accessible, secure, and integrated transport infrastructure. This likely involves IT projects to develop and maintain systems that support these goals.

7. Corridor Projects: The website mentions corridor projects, which involve coordinating work on the large and complex NSW road transport infrastructure. This likely involves IT projects to support the planning, coordination, and execution of these projects.

Use the case IT project budgets fall off the rails:

Q1: What do you understand by team structure?

Team structure refers to the arrangement of roles, responsibilities, and relationships within a team. It defines who does what, who reports to whom, and how tasks are divided and coordinated. The structure can be hierarchical, with clear lines of authority and reporting, or it can be more flat and collaborative, with team members sharing responsibilities and decision-making. The right team structure can facilitate communication, collaboration, and productivity, while the wrong structure can lead to confusion, conflict, and inefficiency.

Q2: What could be possible issues with team capacity?

Team capacity refers to the amount of work a team can handle at a given time. Issues with team capacity can arise from several factors:

1. Overload: If the team is given more work than it can handle, it can lead to stress, burnout, and decreased productivity.
2. Underutilization: If the team's skills and abilities are not fully utilized, it can lead to boredom, lack of motivation, and wasted resources.
3. Skill mismatch: If the team lacks the necessary skills to complete the tasks assigned to them, it can lead to delays, poor quality work, and frustration.
4. Lack of resources: If the team doesn't have the necessary resources (e.g., tools, equipment, information) to do their work, it can limit their capacity.

Q3: How do you relate team capacity to project resource management?

Team capacity is a critical aspect of project resource management. Resource management involves planning, scheduling, and allocating resources (including team members) to tasks and activities in a project. Understanding team capacity helps project managers to:

1. Allocate tasks effectively: By understanding the team's capacity, project managers can ensure that tasks are assigned to team members who have the necessary skills and availability.
2. Plan and schedule work: Knowing the team's capacity helps in creating realistic schedules and deadlines.
3. Manage workload: It helps in balancing the workload among team members to prevent burnout and improve productivity.
4. Identify resource needs: If the team's capacity is insufficient to meet the project's demands, it may be necessary to hire additional staff, provide training, or procure additional resources.

Q4: What criteria would you use to allocate human resources to a task/work – cost, availability, or capacity (productivity), etc.?

Several criteria can be used to allocate human resources to tasks, and the importance of each can depend on the specific project and organization. Some common criteria include:

1. Skills and expertise: The individual's skills and expertise should match the requirements of the task.
2. Availability: The individual should have enough time to complete the task without overloading their workload.
3. Cost: The cost of the individual's time should be in line with the project budget.
4. Capacity: The individual should be able to handle the task in terms of workload and productivity.
5. Team dynamics: The individual's ability to work well with the team and contribute to a positive team dynamic can also be a factor.
6. Development opportunities: Sometimes tasks are assigned to provide individuals with opportunities to learn and grow.

Class QuiZ

- Q1: Who monitors individual risk?
- Q2: Who is responsible for managing project risks?
- Q3: How many risks you need to identify for your project? Why?
- Q4 (a): How to present (the best way to deal with) risk in your project proposal?
- Q4 (b): What is the objective of discussing risks in the project proposal?

A1: Individual risk is typically monitored by the person or entity directly involved or affected by the risk. In a professional context, individuals may monitor their own risks as part of their personal risk management strategy, or it may be the responsibility of their supervisors or managers to oversee individual risks.

A2: The responsibility for managing project risks usually falls on the project manager. The project manager is responsible for identifying potential risks, assessing their potential impact on the project, developing risk mitigation strategies, and implementing risk management processes throughout the project lifecycle.

A3: The number of risks to be identified for a project can vary depending on the nature, size, and complexity of the project. It is generally recommended to identify as many risks as possible to ensure comprehensive risk management. This helps in assessing the potential threats and opportunities that may arise during the project, allowing the project team to develop appropriate strategies to address them.

A4 (a): When presenting risk in a project proposal, it is important to provide a clear and concise description of the identified risks. This includes outlining the potential impact of each risk on the project's objectives, timeline, budget, and stakeholders. It is helpful to categorize risks based on their likelihood and severity, and provide a brief explanation of the proposed risk mitigation strategies.

A4 (b): The objective of discussing risks in a project proposal is to demonstrate a proactive and realistic approach to project management. By addressing risks upfront, the proposal shows that the project team has considered potential obstacles and has plans in place to mitigate or manage them. It provides transparency to stakeholders, instills confidence in the project's feasibility and success, and allows for better decision-making and resource allocation. Additionally, discussing risks can also help in identifying any gaps in the project plan or potential areas of improvement before the project is initiated.

## Week 8 IT Project Case Analysis– Self-driving Uber Issue ##

As an AI, I don't have real-time data or the ability to predict future events. However, I can provide analysis based on the information available up to my last training cut-off in September 2021.

(Q1). What methodology perhaps they used in managing this project? Why?

Uber likely used an Agile or iterative development methodology for their self-driving car project. This approach allows for continuous improvement and adaptation, which is crucial for complex and innovative projects like autonomous driving. It enables the team to learn from each iteration, make necessary adjustments, and continually improve the technology.

(Q2). Do you predict that this project may fail? Why / Why not?

As of my last training data, it's not possible to definitively predict the success or failure of Uber's self-driving car project. The fatal accident was a significant setback, raising safety and ethical concerns. However, failure or success would depend on how Uber addresses these issues, improves its technology, and regains public trust.

(Q3). What the project team could have done well to avoid this risk (accident)?

The project team could have implemented more rigorous safety protocols and testing procedures. This could include better training for safety drivers, more comprehensive simulation testing, and stricter criteria for when and where the autonomous vehicles can operate. They could also have invested more in refining the technology to better recognize and respond to pedestrians.

(Q4). Since this is an IT project, what could be the problems behind this accident?

The accident could have been due to a variety of technical issues, such as flaws in the vehicle's sensor systems, shortcomings in the AI algorithms used to interpret sensor data and make driving decisions, or problems with the vehicle's ability to predict pedestrian behavior. There could also have been issues with the testing and validation processes used to ensure the system's safety before deployment.

(Q5). Will this project’s completion be delayed? Why/Why not? Who to blame if delayed?

The accident likely caused delays as Uber paused its self-driving operations to investigate the incident and improve its safety procedures. The blame for the delay would likely fall on the project management team for not adequately anticipating and mitigating the risks associated with autonomous driving.

(Q6). What are the internal and external factors that may cause a delay in completing this project?

Internal factors could include technical challenges, resource constraints, or organizational issues within Uber. External factors could include regulatory hurdles, public perception and acceptance of self-driving technology, or competition from other companies working on autonomous vehicles.

(Q7). What are the Project Management areas that could be affected by this uncertainty?

This uncertainty could affect many areas of project management, including risk management, stakeholder management, communication management, and quality management.

(Q8). Which stage of lifecycle do you find this project now?

As of my last training data, the project was likely in the testing or deployment stage. However, the accident may have forced it back into a development or review stage to address the safety issues.

(Q9). What this event tells us? Any lessons learned?

This event underscores the importance of safety and risk management in IT projects, especially those involving complex and potentially dangerous technologies like autonomous vehicles. It also highlights the need for rigorous testing and validation processes, and the importance of public trust in the successful deployment of new technologies. Additionally, it demonstrates the potential for unforeseen events to disrupt and delay projects, and the need for contingency plans and adaptability

## Week 8 South Australia Health IT Project ##

Following reports of delays in pathology testing times and lost test results since the introduction of its EPLIS pathology IT system, SA Health has employed 30 extra staff and announced a new taskforce to help fix the problems.
SA Health deputy chief executive Don Frater said the roll out of the new statewide pathology laboratory information system had led to an increase in test turnaround times due to complex initial data-entry requirements.
“Since the introduction of EPLIS we have seen the wait times for some laboratory test results increase for hospitals and GPs,” Frater said. Blood, urine, tumour and genetic tests have been effected.
“We know timely test results are essential in providing prompt and appropriate care for patients, and these delays have the potential to impact the level of care being provided,” he said.
The $37 million system was initially rolled out at the Women’s and Children’s Hospital in March 2017 and has now been implemented at all South Australian metropolitan hospitals and regional laboratories.
The taskforce, which will be headed by independent ehealth advisor Dr Tom Stubbs, will determine any impacts on patient outcomes and make recommendations on how to speed up turnaround times.
“In the interim, all urgent tests are being prioritised and an action plan has been developed by SA Pathology to improve the timeliness of pathology test results for doctors,” Frater said.
Doctors have been alerted to the risk of delay.
“Our clinicians have been instructed in how to request and receive results for critical and urgent tests during this time as we resolve this issue.”
Thirty new staff have been employed at SA Pathology to compensate for “the additional data entry complexities” associated with the new system. Professionals Australia SA director Sarah Andrews said she had been raising concerns for months on behalf of members.
"What we hear from members is that EPLIS is not for purpose and in response members report significant increases to turnaround times. There are lost specimens in the system, and there's alack of specimen tracking and problems with interfacing with the existing and the new equipment," Andrews said.
This is the latest IT crisis in South Australia’s health services, with the new Liberal Government halting the troubled roll out of the EPAS patient record system soon after the March election. It is estimated EPAS will cost taxpayers $471 million over the 10 years to 2021.
Frater said he expects pathology testing times to return to normal levels in the coming weeks.

Q1:Review it and identify the risks, their types and potential impact etc. on the project?

1. Increased Test Turnaround Times: The new system has led to increased test turnaround times due to complex initial data-entry requirements. This is an operational risk that has already materialized and is impacting the project's performance. The potential impact is significant, as it affects the timeliness and quality of patient care.

2. Lost Test Results: There have been reports of lost test results since the introduction of the new system. This is another operational risk that has already occurred. The impact is severe, as lost test results can lead to misdiagnosis, delayed treatment, and potential harm to patients.

3. System Complexity: The new system has "additional data entry complexities" that have required the hiring of 30 new staff. This is a strategic risk that has materialized, leading to increased costs and potential delays. The impact could be significant if the system complexity continues to require additional resources or leads to errors.

4. Interfacing Problems: There are reported problems with interfacing with existing and new equipment. This is a technical risk that could lead to further operational issues, such as data errors or inefficiencies.

5. Reputation Risk: Given the issues with the EPLIS system and the previous problems with the EPAS patient record system, there is a reputation risk for SA Health. If these issues continue, they could damage the organization's reputation, leading to a loss of trust among patients and potential scrutiny from regulators or the public.

6. Risk of Delays in Normalizing Testing Times: While SA Health expects testing times to return to normal in the coming weeks, there is a risk that this may not happen if the issues with the system are not resolved. This is a schedule risk that could lead to further operational and reputation impacts.

7. Risk of Impact on Patient Outcomes: The taskforce will determine any impacts on patient outcomes. This is a significant risk, as any negative impact on patient outcomes could have serious ethical, legal, and reputation implications.

## Week 8 IBM and HP on notice ##

The federal government has put Hewlett-Packard and other vendors behind technology failures like the Australian Tax Office outage on notice, announcing a review of all current IT projects with a capital expenditure above $10 million.
The review, which will take in about 100 projects and report to government in the first half of 2017, will be undertaken by the Digital Transformation Agency. It will recommend "remediations" for troubled projects, including the replacement of vendors where necessary, Assistant Minister for Digital Transformation Angus Taylor told The Australian Financial Review.
Projects to be reviewed include the $1.5 billion Centrelink payments system overhaul, and $1 billion projects for a Department of Defence enterprise resource planning platform and replacement of the Bureau of Meteorology's computer system.
The DTA will also get a new 'investment management office' to oversee future IT projects, and 35 Department of Finance staff with skills across benchmarking, project management, IT policy and cybersecurity were transferred to it in December.
The government could never rule out another incident like 2016's census failure happening again, but the DTA's new office would provide it a "dashboard of costs, benefits, risks and status of projects" so earlier interventions could be made, Mr Taylor said.
The DTA will also help the government meet its target of a 10 per cent increase in the amount of technology work carried out by smaller suppliers.
The Australian Bureau of Statistics and the Australian Tax Office have attracted criticism for their perceived over-dependence on IBM and Hewlett-Packard respectively. More diversity in suppliers was a priority, Mr Taylor said, adding that he'd like to see a "cluster" of Australian firms with a speciality in servicing government technology needs.
The need for a review was a no-brainer, said Shadow Minister for the Digital Economy, Ed Husic. "Given the census fail, the Centrelink robo-debt debacle, the repeated crashing of the ATO website and concern about the Child Support Agency's IT upgrade, we just hope the government can get it completed on deadline," he said.
Mr Husic called on the government to provide "clear explanations about what has been happening with all the tech bungles and how the government will fix them".

Q3: Assume you are an IT project manager. What did you learn from this case study about project risks?

A: This case study presents several key lessons about project risks, particularly in the context of large-scale IT projects:

1. **Vendor Dependence**: Over-reliance on a single vendor can pose a significant risk. If the vendor fails to deliver, the project can suffer major setbacks. Diversifying suppliers can help mitigate this risk.

2. **Complexity of Large-Scale Projects**: Large-scale IT projects, such as the ones mentioned in the case study, are inherently complex and carry significant risks. These can include technical risks, operational risks, financial risks, and more. 

3. **Importance of Early Intervention**: The establishment of the 'investment management office' underscores the importance of early detection and intervention in managing project risks. Having a "dashboard of costs, benefits, risks and status of projects" allows for proactive risk management and timely remediation.

4. **Need for Skilled Project Management**: The transfer of staff with skills in benchmarking, project management, IT policy, and cybersecurity to the Digital Transformation Agency (DTA) highlights the importance of having a skilled project management team that can navigate the complexities and risks of IT projects.

5. **Potential for Reputational Damage**: The failures mentioned in the case study not only had operational and financial impacts but also damaged the reputation of the involved organizations. This underlines the fact that project risks can have far-reaching consequences beyond the project itself.

6. **Importance of Supplier Diversity**: The government's goal of increasing the amount of technology work carried out by smaller suppliers emphasizes the importance of supplier diversity in mitigating risks. This can lead to increased competition, innovation, and resilience.

7. **Need for Clear Communication**: The call for "clear explanations about what has been happening with all the tech bungles and how the government will fix them" highlights the importance of transparency and communication in managing project risks. Stakeholders need to be kept informed about project risks and the steps being taken to address them.

## Week 9 ##

## Week 10 Project Governance ##

- Project governance is aligned with the organization’s governance model and that encompasses the project life cycle.
- Project governance provides direction and defines decision-making procedures and metrics for validating impacts to the project.
- It provides a vehicle for information gathering and reporting to all stakeholders.
- Project governance framework provides the project manager and team with structure, processes, decision-making models and tools for managing the project, while supporting and controlling the project for successful delivery.
- Project governance is a critical element of any project, especially on complex and risky projects.
- It provides a comprehensive, consistent method of controlling the project and ensuring its success by defining and documenting and communicating reliable, repeatable project practices.

Project governance involves stakeholders as well as documented policies, procedures, standards; responsibilities; and authorities. Examples of the elements of a project governance framework include:

- Project success and deliverable acceptance criteria;
- Process to identify, escalate, and resolve issues that arise during the project
- Relationship among the project team, organizational groups, and external stakeholders;
- Project organization chart that identifies project roles;
- Processes and procedures for the communication of information;
- Project decision-making processes;
- Guidelines for aligning project governance and organizational strategy;
- Project life cycle approach;
- Process for stage gate or phase reviews;
- Process for review and approval for changes to budget, scope, quality, and schedule which are beyond the authority of the project manager; and
- Process to align internal stakeholders with project process requirements.

While project governance is the framework in which the project team performs, the team is still responsible for planning, executing, controlling, and closing the project.

Q: As a project team, where would you describe the project governance approach?
**Project Charter**: The project charter outlines the project's purpose, objectives, scope, stakeholders, and high-level governance structure. It defines the project sponsor, project manager, and other key roles, along with their authority and responsibilities.

**Organizational Structure**: The project governance approach clarifies how the project team is structured within the larger organizational context. It defines reporting lines, establishes project committees or steering groups, and outlines decision-making processes.

**Decision-Making Authority**: The governance approach specifies who has the authority to make decisions at different levels of the project. It defines the escalation process for issues or risks that require higher-level decision-making or involvement.

**Communication and Reporting**: The governance approach determines the communication channels and reporting mechanisms within the project team and with external stakeholders. It defines the frequency, format, and content of project status updates, progress reports, and key milestone communications.

**Risk Management**: The governance approach includes the processes and procedures for identifying, assessing, mitigating, and monitoring risks throughout the project lifecycle. It defines the roles and responsibilities for risk management and the escalation process for significant risks.

**Change Management**: The governance approach outlines how changes to project scope, objectives, or requirements are managed. It includes the change control process, which defines how changes are assessed, approved, implemented, and communicated.

**Quality Assurance**: The governance approach establishes the processes for ensuring the quality of project deliverables and adherence to defined standards. It includes quality control measures, quality assurance roles and responsibilities, and procedures for conducting reviews and audits.

**Performance Measurement and Evaluation**: The governance approach defines the metrics and key performance indicators (KPIs) used to monitor project progress and assess success. It outlines the processes for tracking and reporting on project performance against these metrics.

**Stakeholder Engagement**: The governance approach includes strategies for engaging and managing project stakeholders. It identifies the key stakeholders, their interests, and the methods for involving them in decision-making and ensuring their needs are considered.

Q: As a project team, where would you describe the project governance approach?

A: **Governance Structure**: It defines the roles and responsibilities of project stakeholders, such as the project sponsor, project manager, steering committee, and other key individuals or groups involved in decision-making and oversight.

**Decision-Making Processes**: The plan outlines the decision-making authority and processes within the project. It specifies how decisions will be made, who will be responsible for them, and how they will be communicated to the relevant parties.

**Communication and Reporting**: The plan describes the communication channels, frequency, and methods to be used for effective project communication.
