## 2. Contracts ##

- A contract is a mutually binding agreement that obligates the seller to provide the specified products or services and obligates the buyer to pay for them.
- Contracts are legally binding, there is more accountability for delivering the work as stated in the contract.

### 2.1 Types of Contracts ###

Different types of contracts can be used in different situations:

- **Fixed price or lump sum contracts**: Involve a fixed total price for a well-defined product or service
- **Cost reimbursable contracts**: Involve payment to the seller for direct and indirect costs
- **Time and material contracts**: Hybrid of both fixed price and cost reimbursable contracts, often used by consultants
- **Unit price contracts**: Require the buyer to pay the seller a predetermined amount per unit of service

A single contract can include all four of these categories, if it makes sense for that procurement

### 2.2 Contract Types versus Risk ###

**high <----------Buyer's Risk----------> low**
Cost plus percentage of costs (CPPC) <---> Cost plus fixed fee (CPFF) <---> Cost plus incentive fee (CPIF) <---> Cost plus award fee (CPAF) <--->  Fixed-price incentive fee (FPIF) <---> Fixed-price economic price adjustment (FP-EPA) <---> Firm fixed price (FFP)
**low <----------Seller's Risk----------> high**

## 3. Tools and Techniques for Project Procurement Management ##

- Make or buy analysis
- Expert judgment
- Market research

### 4. Procurement Management Plan ###

The following are some of the items that might be included in a procurement management plan:

- Guidelines for types of contracts to be used in different situations
- Standard procurement documents or templates to be used, if applicable
- Guidelines for creating contract work breakdown structures, statements of work, and other procurement documents
- Roles and responsibilities of the project team and related departments, such as the purchasing or legal department
- Guidelines for using independent estimates to evaluate sellers
- Suggestions for managing multiple providers
- Processes for coordinating procurement decisions with other project areas, such as scheduling and performance reporting
- Constraints and assumptions related to purchases and acquisitions
- Lead times for purchases and acquisitions
- Risk mitigation strategies for purchases and acquisitions, such as  insurance contracts and bonds
- Guidelines for identifying prequalified sellers and organizational lists of preferred sellers
- Procurement metrics to assist in evaluating sellers and managing contracts

### 5. Contract Statement of Work ###

- A statement of work (SOW) is a description of the work required for the procurement.
- If a SOW is used as part of a contract to describe only the work required for that particular contract, it is called a contract statement of work

### 6. Procurement Documents ###

- Request for Proposals: Used to solicit proposals from prospective sellers
  - A proposal is a document prepared by a seller when there are different approaches for meeting buyer needs
- Requests for Quotes: Used to solicit quotes or bids from prospective suppliers
  - A bid, also called a tender or quote (short for quotation), is a document prepared by sellers providing pricing for standard items that have been clearly defined by the buyer

### 7. Source Selection Criteria ###

It’s important to prepare some form of evaluation criteria, preferably before issuing a formal RFP or RFQ.
Some possible source selection criteria are:
&radic; Understanding of need
&radic; Overall or life-cycle cost
&radic; Technical capability
&radic; Risk
&radic; Management approach
&radic; Technical approach
&radic; Warranty
&radic; Financial capacity
&radic; Production capacity and interest
&radic; Business size and type
&radic; Past performance of sellers
&radic; References

## 8. Seller Selection ##

- Organizations often do an initial evaluation of all proposals and bids and then develop a short list of potential sellers for further evaluation
- Sellers on the short list often prepare the best and final offer (BAFO)
- Finally, contract signed by the buyer and the selected seller

## 9. Controlling Procurements ##

- Changes to any part of the project need to be reviewed, approved, and documented by the same people in the same way they approved the original part of the plan.
- Evaluation of any change should include an impact analysis. How will the change affect the scope, time, cost, and quality of the goods or services being provided? There must also be a baseline to understand and analyze changes.
- Changes must be documented in writing. Project team members should document all important meetings and telephone calls.
- When procuring complex information systems, project managers and their teams must stay closely involved to make sure the new system will meet business needs and work in an operational environment. Do not assume that everything will go well because you hired a reputable supplier. The buying organization needs to provide expertise as well.
- Have backup plans in case the new system does not work as planned.
- Several tools and techniques can help in contract administration, such as a formal contract change control system, buyer-conducted procurement performance reviews, inspections and audits, performance reporting, payment systems, claims administration, and records management systems.

## 10. Using Software to Assist in Project Procurement Management ##

- Web-based ERP (Electronic Resource Planning): Creating and approving purchasing requisitions, placing purchase orders, and receiving goods and services by using a software system based on Internet technology.
- E-MRO (Maintenance, Repair, and Overhaul): The same as web-based ERP, except that the goods and services ordered are MRO supplies that are not related to a particular product.
- E-sourcing: Identifying new suppliers for a specific category of purchasing requirements using Internet technology.
- E-tendering: Sending requests for information and prices to suppliers and receiving the responses of suppliers using Internet technology.
- E-reverse auctioning: Using Internet technology to buy goods and services from a number of known or unknown suppliers.
- E-informing: Gathering and distributing purchasing information with internal and external parties using Internet technology.
- E-market sites: Expands on web-based ERP to open up value chains. Buying communities can access preferred suppliers’ products and services, add to shopping carts, create requisitions, seek approval, receive purchase orders, and process electronic invoices with integration to suppliers’ supply chains and buyers’ financial systems.


## 11.  Exercise 1 – ICT Procurement Taskforce report ##

<https://www.dta.gov.au/help-and-advice/ict-procurement/ict-procurement-taskforce-report>,
<https://www.dta.gov.au/help-and-advice/ict-procurement/digital-sourcing-framework-ict-procurement/ict-procurement-taskforce-report/government-response-taskforce-report>

The taskforce’s role was to:

- Identify existing procurement barriers
- Look for opportunities to streamline ICT procurement
- Look for ways to make it easier for start-ups and small and medium businesses to compete for government ICT contracts

Task1: Review ICT Procurement Taskforce Report and Government response to the taskforce report and develop learnings for your project team

Government's Response to the Taskforce Report:

The government agrees with the Taskforce's recommendation of developing a comprehensive and contemporary ICT strategy to guide procurement approaches.

The Australian Government plans to implement reporting requirements for procurements from standing offers, such as panels, to provide transparency.

The government agrees with the Taskforce's recommendation of implementing a whole-of-government procurement policy for accessible ICT products.

The government agrees to the ICT Procurement Taskforce recommendation for 'adopting a framework for ICT procurement that includes ICT procurement.

Learnings for your project team:

Regularly review and update your procurement strategies to reflect contemporary best practices.

Develop a comprehensive ICT strategy for your project to guide procurement approaches.

Maintain transparency in your procurement processes, especially when dealing with standing offers.

Ensure your procurement policy is inclusive and accessible, considering all potential vendors and products.

Establish a comprehensive dataset of your project's ICT spend to allow for greater analysis and better decision-making.

Simplify your procurement processes where possible to make it easier for vendors to engage with you.
