# Week 8 IT Project Risk: Tools, Techniques #

## 1. Risk ##

- General meaning -- “the possibility of loss or injury”
- Project risk is an uncertainty that can have a negative or positive effect on meeting project objectives

## 1.1. Best Practice…benefits ##

- Bridging the strategy and tactics gap to ensure that project delivery is tied to organizational needs and vision
- Focusing projects on the benefits they exist to support, rather than producing a setof deliverables
- Managing opportunities proactively as an integral part of business processes at bothstrategic and tactical levels
- Providing useful information to decision makers at all levels when the environmentis uncertain
- Allowing an appropriate level of risk to be taken intelligently with full awareness of the degree of uncertainty and its potential effects on objectives*

## 1.2. Negative & Positive Risk ##

- Negative risks: potential problems that might occur in the project and how they might obstruct project success
- Positive risks: risks that result in good things happening; sometimes called opportunities

## 2. Project Risk Management Processes ##

- Planning risk management : Deciding how to approach and plan the risk management activities for the project
- Identifying risks: Determining which risks are likely to affect a project and documenting the characteristics of each
- Performing qualitative risk analysis: Prioritizing risks based on their probability and impact of occurrence
- Performing quantitative risk analysis: Numerically estimating the effects of risks on project objectives
- Planning risk responses: Taking steps to enhance opportunities and reduce threats to meeting project objectives
- Controlling risk: Monitoring identified and residual risks, identifying new risks, carrying out risk response plans, and evaluating the effectiveness of risk strategies throughout the life of the project

## 2.1. Risks Planning many include ##

- Contingency plans are predefined actions that the project team will take if an identified risk event occurs.
- Fallback plans are developed for risks that have a high impact on meeting project objectives and are put into effect if attempts to reduce the risk do not work.
- Contingency reserves or contingency allowances are funds included in the cost baseline that can be used to mitigate cost or schedule overruns if known risks occur.
- Management reserves are funds held for unknown risks that are used for management control purposes. They are not part of the cost baseline

## 2.2 Categories of Risk ##

Following are some categories of IT project risks.

- Market risk:
- Financial risk
- Technology risk
- People risk
- Structure/process risk

## 2.3. Risks Identification ##

- Identifying risks is the process of understanding what potential events might hurt or enhance a particular project
- The aims of this phase is to identify , classify and prioritizing the organization’s information assets ( Know ourselves) and identify all important types and sources of risk and uncertainty (know our enemy), associated with each of the investment objectives.
- This is a crucial phase. If a risk is not identified it cannot be evaluated and managed
- Risk identification tools and techniques include:
  - Brainstorming
  - The Delphi Technique
  - Interviewing
  - SWOT analysis

## 2.4 What is Risk Assessment ? ##

- Assessing risk is the process of determining the likelihood of the threat being exercised against the vulnerability and the resulting impact from a successful compromise , i.e determine the relative risk for each of the vulnerabilities
- Risk assessment assigns a risk rating or score to each specific information asset, useful in evaluating the relative risk and making comparative ratings later in the risk control process
- Although all elements of the risk management cycle are important, risk assessments provide the foundation for other   elements of the cycle. In particular, risk assessments provide a basis for establishing appropriate policies and selecting cost-effective techniques to implement these policies

## 2.5 Methods of Risk Assessment ##

There are various methods assessing risk, including:

First : Quantitative risk assessment:
generally estimates values of Information Systems components as information, systems, business processes, recovery costs, etc.,
risk can be measured in terms of direct and indirect costs , based on:
(1) the likelihood that a damaging event will occur
(2) the costs of potential losses
(3) the costs of mitigating actions that could be taken.

Second : Qualitative risk assessment:
This approach can be taken by defining

- Risk in more subjective and general terms such as high, medium, and low.
- In this regard, qualitative assessments depend more on the expertise, experience, and judgment of those conducting the assessment.
- Qualitative risk assessments typically give risk results of “High”, “Moderate” and “Low”. However, by providing the impact and likelihood definition tables and the description of the impact, it is possible to adequately communicate the assessment to the organization’s management.

## 2.6 Risk Analysis ##

- Sensitivity analysis. It helps to determine which risks have the most potential impact on the project.

## 2.7 Risk Register ##

- A risk register is:
  - A document that contains the results of various risk management processes and that is often displayed in a table or spreadsheet format
  - A tool for documenting potential risk events and related information

Risk Register – Contents:

1. An identification number for each risk event
2. A rank for each risk event
3. The name of each risk event
4. A description of each risk event
5. The category under which each risk event falls
6. The root cause of each risk
7. Potential responses to each risk
8. The risk owner or person who will own or take responsibility for each risk
9. The probability and impact of each risk occurring.
10. The status of each risk

## 2.8 Planning Risk Responses ##

- Involves selection of control strategies, justification of strategies to upper management, and implementation/monitoring/on going assessment of adopted controls. The five basic response strategies for negative risks are as follows:
  - Risk avoidance or eliminating a specific threat, usually by eliminating its causes. Of course, not all risks can be eliminated, but specific risk events can be.
  - Risk acceptance or accepting the consequences if a risk occurs.
  - Risk transference or shifting the consequence of a risk and responsibility for its management to a third party.
  - Risk mitigation or reducing the impact of a risk event by reducing the probability of its occurrence.
  - Risk escalation or notifying a higher level authority. If the risk is outside of the scope of the project or the proposed response is outside of the project manager’s authority, it would make sense to escalate the risk to a higher-level manager within the organization.
- The five basic response strategies for positive risks are as follows:
  - Risk exploitation or doing whatever you can to make sure the positive risk happens.
  - Risk sharing or allocating ownership of the risk to another party.
  - Risk enhancement or changing the size of the opportunity by identifying and maximizing key drivers of the positive risk.
  - Risk acceptance also applies to positive risks when the project team does not take any actions toward a risk.
  - Risk escalation or notifying a higher level authority also applies to positive risks.

## 2.9 Risk Response Strategies ##

- Response strategies for negative risks:
  - Risk avoidance or eliminating a specific threat, usually by eliminating its causes
  - Risk acceptance or accepting the consequences should a risk occur.
  - Risk transference or shifting the consequence of a risk and responsibility for its management to a third party.
  - Risk mitigation or reducing the impact of a risk event by reducing the probability of its occurrence.
- Response strategies for positive risks:
  - Risk exploitation involves doing whatever you can to make sure the positive risk happens.
  - Risk sharing involves allocating ownership of the risk to another party
  - Risk enhancement involves changing the size of the opportunity by identifying and maximizing key drivers of the positive risk.
  - Risk acceptance applies to positive risks when the project team cannot or chooses not to take any actions toward a risk.

## 2.10 Residual and Secondary Risks ##

- Residual risks are risks that remain after all of the response strategies have been implemented
- Secondary risks are a direct result of implementing a risk response

## 2.11 Risk control ##

- Monitoring risks involves ensuring the appropriate risk responses are performed,
  - tracking identified risks,
  - identifying and analyzing new risk, and evaluating the effectiveness of risk management throughout the entire project.
  - Project risk management does not stop with the initial risk analysis.
- Identified risks may not materialize, or their probabilities of occurrence or loss may diminish.
- Previously identified risks may be determined to have a greater probability of occurrence or a higher estimated loss value.
- Similarly, new risks will be identified as the project progresses.
- Newly identified risks need to go through the same process as those identified during the initial risk assessment.
- A redistribution of resources devoted to risk management may be necessary because of relative changes in risk exposure.

Class QuiZ

- Q1: Who monitors individual risk?
- Q2: Who is responsible for managing project risks?
- Q3: How many risks you need to identify for your project? Why?
- Q4 (a): How to present (the best way to deal with) risk in your project proposal?
- Q4 (b): What is the objective of discussing risks in the project proposal?

A1: Individual risk is typically monitored by the person or entity directly involved or affected by the risk. In a professional context, individuals may monitor their own risks as part of their personal risk management strategy, or it may be the responsibility of their supervisors or managers to oversee individual risks.

A2: The responsibility for managing project risks usually falls on the project manager. The project manager is responsible for identifying potential risks, assessing their potential impact on the project, developing risk mitigation strategies, and implementing risk management processes throughout the project lifecycle.

A3: The number of risks to be identified for a project can vary depending on the nature, size, and complexity of the project. It is generally recommended to identify as many risks as possible to ensure comprehensive risk management. This helps in assessing the potential threats and opportunities that may arise during the project, allowing the project team to develop appropriate strategies to address them.

A4 (a): When presenting risk in a project proposal, it is important to provide a clear and concise description of the identified risks. This includes outlining the potential impact of each risk on the project's objectives, timeline, budget, and stakeholders. It is helpful to categorize risks based on their likelihood and severity, and provide a brief explanation of the proposed risk mitigation strategies.

A4 (b): The objective of discussing risks in a project proposal is to demonstrate a proactive and realistic approach to project management. By addressing risks upfront, the proposal shows that the project team has considered potential obstacles and has plans in place to mitigate or manage them. It provides transparency to stakeholders, instills confidence in the project's feasibility and success, and allows for better decision-making and resource allocation. Additionally, discussing risks can also help in identifying any gaps in the project plan or potential areas of improvement before the project is initiated.
