1. What is a project?
   
   A project is "a temporary endeavor undertaken to create a unique product, service, or result".

   Projects have definite start point and end point

   They are governed by scope, cost and time goals
   Project require resources.

   Can be part of programs, portfolios and strategies

   Projects end when their objectives have been reached or the project has been terminated

   Projects can be large or small and take a short or long time to complete

2. The content of IT projects
   
   IT projects can be very diverse in terms of size, complexity, products produced, application area, and resource requirements
   
   IT project team members often have diverse backgrounds and skill sets
   
   IT projects use diverse technologies that change rapidly. Even within one technology area, people must be highly specialized

3. What is Project Management?
   
   Project management is "the application of knowledge, skills, tools and techniques to project activities to meet project requirements"
   
   Project management is a complex team-based activity where various types of technologies are an inherent part of the project management process
   
   Largely process-driven discipline
   
   Applicable to all industries and domains of activities
   
   Several standards to support effective project management
   
   The primary challenge of project management is to achieve all of the project goals within the given constraints.

4. Triple Constraints of Project Management
   Project managers strive to meet the triple constraints(project scope, time, and cost goals) which facilitate the entire process to meet the needs and expectations of project stakeholders.

5. Project Manager vs Program Manager
   
    Project managers work with project sponsors, project team, and other people involved in a project to meet project goals
    
    Program: group of related projects managed in a coordinated way to obtain benefits and control not available from managing them individually
    
    Program managers oversee programs; often act as bosses for project managers

6. The role of a Project Manager
   
   Job descriptions vary, but most include responsibilities like planning, scheduling, coordinating, and working with people to achieve project goals
   
   Remember that 97% of successful projects were led by experienced project managers, who can often help influence success factors

1. Organizational Structures: Functional, Project, and Matrix

   Functional: A functional structure is a type of business structure that organizes a company into different departments based on areas of expertise. These departments serve as functional units and are overseen by functional managers or department heads.
   
   Project: The project organizational structure is an essential configuration for determining the hierarchy of people, their function, workflow and reporting system. It is a factor in business that plays a fundamental role in guiding and defining the way in which the organization carries out its operations.
   
   Matrix: A matrix structure is a combination of two or more types of organizational structures. It is a way of arranging your business so that you set up reporting relationships as a grid, or a matrix, rather than in the traditional hierarchy

1. Project Management Methodologies
   A methodology is a system of practices, techniques, procedures and rules used by those who work in a discipline. 
   
   Popular PM Methodologies:
   Waterfall Project Management
   Agile Project Management
   PRINCE2

2. Waterfall Project Management
   
    Traditional, or “waterfall” project management handles things sequentially, from the concept and planning phase through to development and quality assurance and finally project completion and maintenance.

    Waterfall methodology is most often applied to large software development projects as thorough planning and predictability are supreme to the project process and success.

3. The Agile development principles
   
    Satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of software capabilities and services through short software.

    Embracing the environment of change.

    Business development, management, and developers must 
    cooperate and collaborate throughout the development 
    project

    Communication needs to be face-to-face

    The Agile development process is designed to allow a 
    sustainable, constant pace development throughout the 
    entire development project.

4. Agile Project Management

    Agile project management focuses on adaptability to changing situations and constant, regular feedback – whether it’s from the client or from other members of the team.
    
    This is ideal when clients or management need to be in on the production process, resulting in changing requirements and drastic shifts in team assignments.
    
    Agile project management is usually ideal for smaller software projects and/or those with accelerated development schedules.
    
    Agile means being able to move quickly and easily, but some people feel that project management, as they have seen it used, does not allow people to work quickly or easily.
    
    Early software development projects often used a waterfall approach. As technology and businesses became more complex, the approach was often difficult to use because requirements were unknown or continuously changing.
    
    Agile today means using a method based on iterative and incremental development, in which requirements and solutions evolve through collaboration.

    Agile Scope Management: Scope is not well understood, but needs to be controlled
    
    Agile Time Management: Schedule must be flexible due to changes
    
    Agile Cost Management: Costs are more difficult to estimate
    
    Agile Risk Management: Higher risk aspects of project are completed first
    
    Agile Quality Management: Quality assessed after each iteration

5. Scrum 
   
   An iterative project management methodology that thrives in situations where requirements constantly shift .
   
   Scrum is part of the Agile movement.
   
   The Scrum approach to agile software development marks a dramatic departure from waterfall management. 
   
   Scrum and other agile methods were inspired by shortcomings of the waterfall method. 
   
   Scrum emphasizes collaboration, functioning software, team self management, and the flexibility to adapt to emerging business realities.

6. PRINCE2
   
   PRINCE2 is a government-endorsed project management methodology, released and supported by the UK government in 1996. 

    It is a very process-oriented methodology, dividing projects into multiple stages, each with their own plans and processes to follow .

7. PMI’s PMBOK
    Initiating, Planning, Executing, Monitoring, Closing

8. Project Goal, Objectives, Deliverable, and Scope

    Project Goal: Long-term

    Objectives: Short-term and practical (why do your want to do this project)

    A deliverable is a product produced as part of a project, such as hardware or software, planning documents, or meeting minutes

    Scope refers to all the work involved in creating the products of the project and the processes used to create them.

9. Project Scope Management Processes

        Requirements Management Plan: 

            The PMBOK describes requirements as "conditions or capabilities that must be met by the project or present in the product, service, or result to satisfy an agreement or other formally imposed specification", The requirements management plan documents how project requirements will be analyzed, documented, and managed.

        Collection Requirements:

            For some IT projects, it is helpful to divide requirements development into categories called elicitation, analysis, specification, and validation. It is important to use an iterative approach to defining requirements since they are often unclear early in a project


        Relative Cost to Correct a Software Requirement Defect Cost spend: Design and architecture < Implementation < Integration testing < Customer beta test< Postproduct release

        Creating the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)

            A WBS is a deliverable-oriented grouping of the work involved in a project that defines the total scope of the project.
            
            WBS is a foundation document that provides the basis for planning and managing project schedules, costs, resources, and changes.
            
            Decomposition is subdividing project deliverables into smaller pieces.
            
            A work package is a task at the lowest level of the WBS.
            
            The scope baseline includes the approved project scope statement and its associated WBS and WBS dictionary.

        Several type of WBS:
            
                - WBS Organized by Product
                - WBS Organized by Phase(Most common used)
                - WBS Organized in Tabular Form
                - Intranet WBS and Gantt Chart in Microsoft Project 
        
        Approaches to Developing WBSs:

            Using guidelines: Some organizations, like the Department of Defense (DOD), provide guidelines for preparing WBSs.
            
            The analogy approach: Review WBSs of similar projects and tailor to your project.
            
            The top-down approach: Start with the largest items of the project and break them down.
            
            The bottom-up approach: Start with the specific tasks and roll them up.
            
            Mind-mapping approach:  Mind mapping is a technique that uses branches radiating out from a core idea to structure thoughts and ideas.
        
        The WBS Dictionary:

            Many WBS tasks are vague and must be explained more so people know what to do and can estimate how long it will take and what it will cost to do the work. 
            
            A WBS dictionary is a document that describes detailed information about each WBS item
        

    5. Validate Scope:

            - Accepted deliverables
            - Change requests
            - Work performance information
            - Project documents updates
        
        Validating Scope:

            It is very difficult to create a good scope statement and WBS for a project.
            
            It is even more difficult to verify project scope and minimize scope changes.
            
            Scope validation involves formal acceptance of the completed project deliverables.
            
            Acceptance is often achieved by a customer inspection and then sign-off on key deliverables.

        Scope Management Issue

            Many countries have had difficulties controlling the scope of large projects, especially those that involve advanced technologies and many different users.
            
            There were many problems in developing and implementing the smart card.

    6. Control Scope:
        Control Scope is the process of monitoring the status of the project and product scope and managing changes to the scope baseline.

            - Organizational process assets updates
        
        Controlling Scope:

            The core of Scope control:  Controlling changes to the project scope
            
            Goals of scope control are to
                –control the factors that cause scope changes
                –assure changes are processed according to procedures developed as part of integrated change control, and
                –manage changes when they occur

1. Why Project Time Management ?
   
    Delivering projects on time is one of the biggest challenges in IT projects.Time has the least amount of flexibility; it passes no matter what happens on a project. Schedule issues are the main reason for conflicts on projects, especially during the second half of projects

2. Project Time Management Processes:

    1. Plan Schedule Management: determining the policies, procedures, and documentation that will be used for planning, executing, and controlling the project schedule

        Inputs:
            
            - Project management plan

            - Expert judgement
            - Analytical techniques
            - Meetings

        Outputs:
                    
            - Schedule management plan

    2. Define Activities: identifying the specific activities that the project team members and stakeholders must perform to produce the project deliverables deliverables.

        Inputs:
            
            - Schedule management plan
            - Scope baseline
            - Enterprise environmental factors
            - Organizational process assets
        
        Tools and Techniques:
                
            - Decomposition
            - Rolling wave planning
            - Expert judgement

        Outputs:
                    
            - Activity list
            - Activity attributes
            - Milestone list

        Defining Activities:

            An activity or task is an element of work normally found on the work breakdown structure (WBS) that has an expected duration, a cost, and resource requirements. 
            Activity definition involves developing a more detailed WBS and supporting explanations to understand all the work to be done so you can develop realistic cost and duration estimates.

        Activity Lists and Attributes:

            An activity list is a tabulation of activities to be included on a project schedule that includes
                – the activity name
                – an activity identifier or number
                – a brief description of the activity
                
            Activity attributes provide more information such as predecessors, successors, logical relationships, leads and lags, resource requirements, constraints, imposed dates, and assumptions related to the activity
        
        Milestones:

            A milestone is a significant event in a project that occurs at a point in time. 
            
            It often takes several activities and many tasks to complete a milestone.
            
            They’re useful tools for setting schedule goals and monitoring progress.


    3. Sequence activity

        Involves reviewing activities and determining tasks dependencies.

        Three types of Dependencies:

            Mandatory dependencies: essential in the nature of the work being performed on a project, sometimes referred to as hard logic.
            
            Discretionary dependencies: defined by the project team,  sometimes referred to as soft logic and should be used with care since they may limit later scheduling options.
            
            External dependencies: involve relationships between project and non-project activities.

        Network diagrams:

            Network diagrams are the preferred technique for showing activity sequencing. 
            
            A network diagram is a graphic display of the logical relationships among, or sequencing of, project activities

        Network Diagram for a Project:

            Activity-on-node (AON).

            Activity-on-arrow (AOA): 
                Activities are represented by arrows
                Nodes or circles are the starting and ending points of activities
                Can only show finish-to-start dependencies

            Precedence Diagramming Method (PDM).

        Process for Creating AOA Diagrams:

           1. Find all the activities that start at node 1. Draw their finish nodes 
           and draw arrows between node 1 and those finish nodes. Put 
           the activity letter or name and duration estimate on the 
           associated arrow 
           2. Continue drawing the network diagram, working from left to 
           right. Look for bursts and merges. Bursts occur when a single 
           node is followed by two or more activities. A merge occurs when 
           two or more nodes precede a single node
           3. Continue drawing the project network diagram until all activities 
           are included on the diagram that have dependencies
           4. As a rule of thumb, all arrowheads should face toward the right, 
           and no arrows should cross on an AOA network diagram
        
        Precedence Diagramming Method (PDM):

            Activities are represented by boxes
            Arrows show relationships between activities
            More popular than AOA and used by project management 
            software
            Better at showing different types of dependencies

    4. Estimating Activity Resources:

        Before estimating activity durations, you must have a good idea of the quantity and type of resources that will be assigned to 
        each activity; resources are people, equipment, and materials.

        Consider important issues in estimating resources

            – How difficult will it be to do specific activities on this project?
            – What is the organization’s history in doing similar activities?
            – Are the required resources available?

        A resource breakdown structure is a hierarchical structure that 
        identifies the project’s resources by category and type.

        Estimate Activity Resources is the process of estimating the type and quantities of material, human resources, equipment, or supplies required to perform each activity

            - Activity resource requirements
            - Resource breakdown structure
            - Project documents updates

    5. Estimating Activity Duration

        Estimating the number of work periods that are needed to complete individual activities.
        
        Estimating Activity Duration:
        
            Duration includes the actual amount of time worked on an activity plus elapsed time.
            
            Effort is the number of workdays or work hours required to complete a task.
            
            Effort does not normally equal duration
        
        Inputs:
                
             - Schedule management plan
             - Activity list

            - Activity duration estimates
            - Project documents updates 
        
        Three-Point Estimates:

            Instead of providing activity estimates as a discrete number, such as four weeks, it’s often helpful to create a three-point estimate
                –an estimate that includes an optimistic, most likely, and pessimistic estimate, such as three weeks for the optimistic, four weeks for the most likely, and five weeks for the pessimistic estimate

            Three-point estimates are needed for PERT analysis. 
        
        Lead Time and Lag Time:

            Lead: When the first activity is still running and second activity starts, this is called Lead. The balance of time for the first activity is known as Lead Time. Lead Time is the overlap between the first and second activity.
            
            Lag: When the first activity completes, if there is then a delay or wait period before the second activity starts, this is called lag and the delay is known as the Lag Time. Lag Time is the delay between the first and second activity.
    
    6. Developing the Schedule

            - Project schedule
            - Schedule baseline
            - Schedule data
            - Project calendars
            - Project management plan updates
            - Project documents updates
        
        Gantt Charts:

            Gantt charts provide a standard format for displaying project schedule information by listing project activities and their corresponding start and finish dates in a calendar format.
            
            Symbols include:
                – A black diamond: a milestones 
                – Thick black bars: summary tasks
                – Lighter horizontal bars: durations of tasks
                – Arrows: dependencies between tasks

        Adding Milestones to Gantt Charts:
            Many people like to focus on meeting milestones, especially for large projects.
            
            Milestones emphasize important events or accomplishments on projects.

            Normally create milestone by entering tasks with a zero duration, or you can mark any task as a milestone.
        
        Critical Path Method:

            CPM is a network diagramming technique used to predict total project duration.
            
            A critical path for a project is the series of activities that determines the earliest time by which the project can be completed.

            The critical path is the longest path through the network diagram and has the least amount of slack or float
            
            Slack or float is the amount of time an activity may be delayed without delaying a succeeding activity or the project finish date.

        Calculating the Critical Path:

            Develop a good network diagram

            Add the duration estimates for all activities on each paththrough the network diagram.

            The longest path is the critical path

            If one or more of the activities on the critical path takes longer than planned, the whole project schedule will slip unless the 
            project manager takes corrective action.

        Critical Path: 

            The critical path is not the one with all the critical activities; it only accounts for time.
            
            There can be more than one critical path if the lengths of two or more paths are the same.
            
            The critical path can change as the project progresses

        Calculate Early and Late Start and Finish Times:

            A forward pass through the network diagram determines the early start and finish dates
            
            A backward pass determines the late start and finish dates
        
        Shortening a Project Schedule:

            Shortening durations of critical activities/tasks by adding more resources or changing their scope.
            
            Crashing activities by obtaining the greatest amount of schedule compression for the least incremental cost.
            
            Fast tracking activities by doing them in parallel or overlapping them

        Critical Chain Scheduling:

            Critical chain scheduling
                – a method of scheduling that considers limited resources when creating a project schedule and includes buffers to protect the project completion date
            Attempts to minimize multitasking
                – when a resource works on more than one task at a time

        Buffers and Critical Chain: 

            A buffer is additional time to complete a task.
            
            In traditional estimates, people often add a buffer to each task and use it if it’s needed or not.
            
            Critical chain scheduling removes buffers from individual tasks and instead creates
                – a project buffer or additional time added before the project’s due date
                – feeding buffers or additional time added before tasks on the critical path

        Program Evaluation and Review Technique (PERT)

             PERT is a network analysis technique used to estimate project duration when there is a high degree of uncertainty about the individual activity duration estimates.
             
             PERT uses probabilistic time estimates
                – duration estimates based on using optimistic, most likely, and pessimistic estimates of activity durations, or a three-point estimate
    
    7. Control Schedule
    
        Control Schedule is the process of monitoring the status of project activities to update project progress and manage changes to the schedule baseline to achieve the plan.

        Control Schedule– Suggestions:
            
            Perform reality checks on schedules.
            
            Allow for contingencies.
            
            Don’t plan for everyone to work at 100% capacity all the time.
            
            Hold progress meetings with stakeholders and be clear and honest in communicating schedule issues.

        Reality Checks on Scheduling：

            First review the draft schedule or estimated completion date in the project charter.

            Prepare a more detailed schedule with the project team.

            Make sure the schedule is realistic and followed. 

            Alert top management well in advance if there are schedule problems

1. What is Cost?

   Cost is a resource sacrificed or foregone to achieve a specific objective or something given up in exchange.
   
   Costs are usually measured in monetary units like dollars.

2. Project Cost Management？
   
   Project cost management includes the processes required to ensure that the project is completed within an approved budget。

3. Project Cost Management Processes

    Planning cost management: determining the policies, 
    procedures, and documentation that will be used for planning, executing, and controlling project cost.

    Estimating costs: developing an approximation or estimate of the costs of the resources needed to complete a project.
    
    Determining the budget: allocating the overall cost estimate to individual work items to establish a baseline for measuring performance.

    Controlling costs: controlling changes to the project budget.

4. Financial Terms To Use
   
   Most members of an executive board better understand and are more interested in financial terms than IT terms, so IT project managers must speak their language (financial terms)

    – Profits are revenues minus expenditures.
    – Profit margin is the ratio of revenues to profits, net income divided by revenue, or net profits divided by sales
    – Life cycle costing considers the total cost of ownership, or development plus support costs, for a project 
    – Cash flow analysis determines the estimated annual costs and benefits 
    for a project and the resulting annual cash flow

5. Costs and Benefits
   
   Tangible costs or benefits are those costs or benefits that an organization can easily measure in dollars.
   
   Intangible costs or benefits are costs or benefits that are difficult to measure in monetary terms.
   
   Direct costs are costs that can be directly related to producing the products and services of the project.
   
   Indirect costs are costs that are not directly related to the products or services of the project, but are indirectly related to performing the project.
   
   Sunk cost is money that has been spent in the past; when deciding what projects to invest in or continue,you should not include sunk costs.

6. What Is Reserve?
   
   Reserves are dollars included in a cost estimate to mitigate cost risk by allowing for future situations that are difficult to predict

        – Contingency reserves allow for future situations that may be partially planned for (sometimes called known unknowns) and are included in the project cost baseline
        – Management reserves allow for future situations that are unpredictable 
        (sometimes called unknown unknowns)

7. Planning Cost Management
   
   The project team uses expert judgment, analytical techniques, and meetings to develop the cost management plan.
   
   A cost management plan includes:

        – Level of accuracy and units of measure
        – Organizational procedure links
        – Control thresholds
        – Rules of performance measurement
        – Reporting formats
        – Process descriptions

    Tools and Techniques
        Basic tools and techniques for cost estimates:
        – Analogous or top-down estimates: use the actual cost of a previous, similar project as the basis for estimating the cost of the current project
        – Bottom-up estimates: involve estimating individual work items or activities and summing them to get a project total
        – Parametric modeling uses project characteristics (parameters) in a mathematical model to estimate the project costs

    Issues with IT Projects:

        Estimates are done too quickly
        People lack estimating experience
        Human beings are biased toward underestimation
        Management desires accuracy
    
    Things to Know for Cost Estimate
        Know what it will be used for,
        Gather as much information as possible,
        Clarify the ground rules and assumptions for the estimate
        If possible, estimate costs by major WBS categories
        Create a cost model to make it easy to make changes to and document the estimate

 10. Determining the Budget

      Cost budgeting involves allocating the project cost estimate to 
     individual work items over time
      The WBS is a required input to the cost budgeting process since 
     it defines the work items

    Earned Value Management (EVM)

    Earned value management (EVM) is a technique that combines scope, time, cost and resource measurements to assess project performance and progress.

    You must enter actual information periodically to use EVM

    It is a common method of measuring performance of projects

    In Earned Value Management, unlike in traditional management, there are three data sources: The planned value (PV), Actual cost (AC), The earned value (EV)

    Three data source of Earned Value Management
        The planned value (PV), formerly called the budgeted cost of work scheduled (BCWS), also called the budget, is that portion of the approved total cost estimate planned to be spent on an activity during a given period

        Actual cost (AC), formerly called actual cost of work performed (ACWP), is the total of direct and indirect costs incurred in accomplishing work on an activity during a given period
        
        The earned value (EV), formerly called the budgeted cost of work performed (BCWP), is an estimate of the value of the physical work actually completed
        EV is based on the original planned costs for the project or activity and the rate at which the team is completing work on the project or activity to date

    Two basic expressions of variance of EVM

        After those three values are established, a variance analysis can be performed. There are two basic expressions of variance, schedule variance and cost variance.

        Schedule variance (SV) is a measure of schedule performance expressed as the difference between the earned value and the planned value.
        Equation: SV = EV – PV

        Cost variance (CV) is the amount of budget deficit or surplus at a given point in time, expressed as the difference between earned value and the actual cost. 
        Equation: CV= EV − AC.


    Two examinations of performance indexes of EVM
        Another analysis that can be done by using EVMS is that of Performance or establishing the project’s burn rate. Two examinations of performance are available to the project manager, Schedule Performance Index (SPI) and Cost Performance Index (CPI).

        The schedule performance index (SPI) is a measure of schedule efficiency expressed as the ratio of earned value to planned value. 
        Equation: SPI = EV/PV

        The cost performance index (CPI) is a measure of the cost efficiency of budgeted resources, expressed as a ratio of earned value to actual cost. 
        Equation: CPI = EV/AC

    Understanding Earned Value Numbers

        Negative numbers for cost and schedule variance indicate problems in those areas

        CPI and SPI less than 100% indicate problems
        Problems mean the project is costing more than planned (over budget) or taking longer than planned (behind schedule)

        The budget at completion (BAC) is the original total budget for the project

        The CPI can be used to calculate the estimate at completion (EAC = BAC/CPI )—an estimate of what it will cost to complete the project based on performance to date.

1. Defining Project Quality
   The degree to which a set of inherent characteristics fulfils requirements” (ISO9000:2000), defined by ISO (The International Organization for Standardization)

2. Understanding Quality– Expert Views
   
    Quality is based on

     - Control to requirements: The project’s processes and products meet written specifications
     - Fitness for use: A product can be used as it was intended
    
    Experts define quality as
      - way of life
      - continuous improvement
      - getting things right first time
      - meet or exceed clients' expectations

    “Quality is a framework of culture, behaviours, processes and tools that support consistently meeting the commitments to my client, my corporation, my people, and myself.”

3. Who to manage “ Project Quality”?
        
    Project Manager is ultimately responsible for quality management in IT projects.

    The project manager is in charge of the Quality Management/ Control process in general. A quality control person or quality specialists may also play a specialized function in some projects. Although each project team member should review their individual work as part of the process, the project manager is ultimately responsible for the project's overall quality.

4. Project Quality Management Processes
   
   Processes include:
   
    - Plan Quality Management: Identifying which quality standards are relevant to the project and how to satisfy them
    - Perform Quality Assurance: Periodically evaluating overall project performance to ensure the project will satisfy the relevant quality standards
    - Control Quality : Monitoring specific project results to ensure that they comply with the relevant quality standards

5. Plan Quality Management
   
    Plan Quality Management is the process of identifying quality requirements and/or standards for the project and its deliverables and documenting how the project will demonstrate compliance with relevant quality requirements. 

6. Plan Quality Management – Cost-Benefit Analysis

    Meeting quality requirements include less rework, higher productivity, lower costs, increased stakeholder satisfaction, and increased profitability. 

    A cost-benefit analysis for each quality activity compares the cost of the quality step to the expected benefit.

7. Plan Quality Management – Cost of Quality
   
   The Cost of Quality can be widely distributed in two categories: 
   - Costs of conformance (costs of control) 
   - Costs of non-conformance (costs of failure of control)

    Cost of Conformance: 

        Prevention costs: traning, document processing, equipment, time to do it right.
    
        Apprals costs: testing, destructive testing loss, inspections.

    cost of nonconformance: 

        Internal fallure costs: rework, scrap.

        External fallure costs: liabilities, warranty work, lost business.

8. Plan Quality Management – Use Basic Quality Tools
   
   (a) Cause-and-Effect Diagram

        Also known as fishbone or Ishikawa diagrams
        Cause-and-effect diagrams trace complaints about quality problems back to the responsible production operations
        They help you find the root cause of a problem
    
    (b) Quality Control Chart

        A control chart is a graphic display of data that illustrates the results of a process over time
        
        The main use of control charts is to prevent defects, rather than to detect or reject them
        
        Quality control charts allow you to determine whether a process is in control or out of control
        
        The seven run rule states that if seven data points in a row are all below the mean, above the mean, or are all increasing or decreasing, then the process needs to be examined for non-random problems.

    (c) Checksheet
        A checksheet is used to collect and analyze data

        It is sometimes called a tally sheet or checklist, depending on its format

        In the example, most complaints arrive via text message, and there are more complaints on Monday and Tuesday than on other days of the week.

    (d) Flowcharts
    
        Flowcharts are graphic displays of the logic and flow of processes that help you analyze how problems occur and how processes can be improved

        They show activities, decision points, and the order of how 
        information is processed
    
    (e) Scatter diagram

    (f) Histogram

    (g) Pareto Chart/Diagram

        Identify and prioritize problem areas 

        Pareto analysis is also called the 80-20 rule, meaning that 80 percent of problems are often due to 20 percent of the causes

9. Other Quality Tools — Six Sigma
    
    Six Sigma is uniquely driven by close understanding of customer needs, disciplined use of facts, data, and statistical analysis, and diligent attention to managing, improving, and reinventing business processes

    Target to achieve no more than 3.4 defects per million opportunities

    Training and Certification follow the “Belt” system (Master Black, Black, Green, Yellow, and White Belt)

    It makes business processes more effective and efficient

        Six Sigma projects normally follow a five-phase improvement process called DMAIC

        DMAIC stands for:
            • Define: Define the problem/opportunity, process, and customer 
            requirements
            • Measure: Define measures, then collect, compile, and display data
            • Analyze: Examine process details to find improvement opportunities
            • Improve: Generate solutions and ideas for improving the problem
            • Control: Track and verify the stability of the improvements and the predictability of the solution

10. Other Quality Tools – Six 9s of Quality
    
    Six 9s of quality is a measure of quality control equal to 1 fault in 1 million opportunities

    For instance -- 99.9999 % service availability for a system or 
    30 seconds of down time a year

11. Perform Quality Assurance: Perform Quality Assurance is the process of auditing the quality requirements and the results from quality control measurements to ensure that appropriate quality standards and operational definitions are used.
    
12. Perform Quality Assurance – Quality Audits

    A quality audit is a structured, independent process to determine if project activities comply with organizational and project policies, processes, and procedures. 

    The objectives may include: 
    - Identify all good and best practices being implemented; 
    - Identify all nonconformity (unconventional), gaps, and 
    shortcomings; 
    - Share good practices introduced or implemented; 
    - Proactively offer assistance in a positive manner; 
    - Highlight contributions of each audit in the lessons learned repository of the organization

13. Control Quality: Control Quality is the process of monitoring and recording results of executing the quality activities to assess performance and recommend necessary changes.
    
14. Quality Control Strategy -- Testing

    Testing should be done during almost every phase of the IT product development life cycle.

    Testing does not sufficiently prevent software defects because:

        – The number of ways to test a complex system is huge
        – Users will continue to invent new ways to use a system that its developers never considered
    
15. Quality Control Strategy -- Types of Tests

    Unit testing tests each individual component to ensure it is as defect-free as possible
    
    Integration testing occurs between unit and system testing to test functionally grouped components
    
    System testing tests the entire system as one entity
    User acceptance testing is an independent test performed by end users prior to accepting the delivered system

16. Quality Standards— ISO 9000
    
    ISO 9000 is a quality system standard that:
    – Consists three-parts: continuous cycle of planning, controlling, 
    and documenting quality in an organization
    – Provides minimum requirements needed for an organization to 
    meet its quality certification standards
    – Helps organizations around the world reduce costs and 
    improve customer satisfaction

17. Project Workplace and Quality
    
    No correlation between productivity and programming language, years of experience, or salary.

    A dedicated workspace and a quiet work environment were key factors to improving programmer productivity

18. Maturity Models – CMMI & OPM3    
    
    Maturity models are frameworks for helping organizations improve their processes and systems
    
    The Software Engineering Institute’s Capability Maturity Model 
    
    Integration (CMMI) is a process improvement approach that provides organizations with the essential elements of effective processes
    
    PMI released the Organizational Project Management Maturity Model (OPM3) in December 2003

19. Maturity Models -- CMMI Levels
    
    CMMI levels, from lowest to highest, are:
        – Incomplete
        – Performed
        – Managed
        – Defined
        – Quantitatively Managed
        – Optimizing
        
        Companies may not get to bid on government projects unless 
        they have a CMMI Level 3

# LEC 6

1. Project Resource Management
   
    Q1: What does project resource management do?

    Q2: What role resource plays to scope, time, and costs?
        Project Resource Management Processes include:
        – Plan resource management: identifying and documenting the method of 
        estimate, acquire, manage, and utilize physical and team resources. 
        – Estimate Activity Resources: Estimating team resources, type and quantities 
        of material and equipment needed to complete project works.
        – Acquire Resources: getting the needed personnel assigned to and working on 
        the project
        – Develop project team: building individual and group skills to enhance project 
        performance
        – Manage project team: tracking team member performance, motivating team 
        members, providing timely feedback, resolving issues and conflicts, and 
        coordinating changes to help enhance project performance 
        – Control Resources: Ensuring that resources are available, monitor the 
        utilization and take corrective action wherever necessary.
    
    Process (1)-- Plan Resource Management

        Identifying and documenting the method of estimate, acquire, manage, and utilize physical and team resources.
    
    Human Resource:

        Planning Human Resource Management is the process of identifying and documenting project roles,responsibilities, required skills, reporting relationships, and creating a staffing management plan.
    
    Why Is Human Resource Management Important?

        Most important asset in projects
        People determine the success and failure of organizations and projects

    Keys to Managing People

    Psychologists and management theorists have devoted much research and thought to the field of managing people at work.

    Important areas related to project human resource management include:
        – motivation theories
        – influence and power
        – Effectiveness
        – Emotional intelligence
        – Leadership
    
    Intrinsic and Extrinsic Motivation

        Intrinsic motivation causes people to participate in an activity for their own enjoyment
        
        Extrinsic motivation causes people to do something for a reward or to avoid a penalty

    Hierarchy of Needs

        Maslow developed a hierarchy of needs which states that people’s behaviors are guided or motivated by a sequence of needs.
    
    Influences that Succeed and Fail Projects: 

        Projects are more likely to succeed when project managers influence with
            – expertise
            – work challenge

        Projects are more likely to fail when project managers rely too heavily on

        – authority
        – money
        – penalty
    
    Improving Effectiveness on Projects:

        Project managers can apply Covey’s 7 habits to improve effectiveness on projects
        
            – Be proactive
            – Begin with the end in mind
            – Put first things first
            – Think win/win
            – Seek first to understand, then to be understood
            – Synergize
            – Sharpen the saw

    Empathic Listening and Rapport

        Good project managers are empathic listeners - they listen with the intent to understand
        
        Before you can communicate with others, you must have rapport – a relation of harmony
        
        Mirroring is the matching of certain behaviors of the other person, a technique to help establish rapport

    Emotional Intelligence
    
        Emotional intelligence (EI) is knowing and managing one’s own emotions and understanding the emotions of others for improved performance.
        
        EI is more valued than IQ (intelligence quotient) in project recruitment.

    Responsibility Assignment Matrices
    
        A matrix that maps the work of the project as described in the WBS to the people responsible for performing the work as described in the OBS
        
        Can be created in different ways to meet unique project needs

    Responsibility VS Accountability
    
        Responsibility may be bestowed, but accountability must be taken. In other words, responsibility can be given or received, even assumed, but that doesn’t automatically guarantee that personal accountability will be taken. Which means that it’s possible to bear responsibility for something or someone but still lack accountability.

        The accountable person is the individual who is ultimately answerable for the activity or decision.

        The responsible person is the individual(s) who actually complete the task.

2. Estimate Activity Resources: Estimating team resources, type and quantities of material and equipment needed to complete project works.
   
    Resource Histogram: 
        A resource histogram is a column chart that shows the number of resources assigned to a project over time
    
3. Aquire Project Team : Acquire Project Team is the process of confirming human resource availability and obtaining the team necessary to complete project activities.
   
    Resource Loading: 

        Resource loading refers to the number of individual resources an existing schedule requires during specific time periods

        Overallocation means more resources than are available are assigned to perform work at a given time

    Resource Levelling:

        Resource leveling is a technique for resolving resource conflicts by delaying tasks

        The main purpose of resource leveling is to create a smoother distribution of resource usage and reduce overallocation
    
4. Develop Project Team: Develop Project Team is the process of improving competencies, 
team member interaction, and overall team environment to 
enhance project performance.

    Tuckman Model of Team Development: 
        Forming
        Storming
        Norming
        Performing
        Adjourning

    Reward and Recognition Systems
        Team-based reward and recognition systems can promote teamwork

        Focus on rewarding teams for achieving specific goals

        Allow time for team members to mentor and help each other to meet project goals and develop human resources
    
5. Manage project team: Manage Project Team is the process of tracking team member performance, providing feedback, resolving issues, and managing team changes to optimize project performance.
    
    Manage Conflict within the Team:

        Conflict often produces important results, such as new ideas, better alternatives, and motivation to perform better and collaboration opportunities.
    
    Conflict Handling Modes: 
        Confrontation: Directly face a conflict using a problem-solving approach

        Compromise: Use a give-and-take approach

        Smoothing: De-emphasize areas of difference and emphasize areas of agreement

        Forcing: The win-lose approach

        Withdrawal: Retreat or withdraw from an actual or potential disagreement

        Collaborating: Decision makers incorporate different viewpoints and insights to develop consent and commitment

    Dysfunctions of a Team: 

        The five dysfunctions of teams are: 
        Absence of trust
        Fear of conflict
        Lack of commitment
        Avoidance of accountability
        Inattention to results
    
    Strategies of Managing Project Teams:

        Be patient and kind with your team

        Fix the problem instead of blaming people

        Establish regular, effective meetings

        Allow time for teams to go through the basic team-building stages
        Limit the size of work teams to three to seven members

        Plan some social activities to help project team members and other stakeholders get to know each other better

        Emphasize team identity

        Nurture team members and encourage them to help each other

        Take additional actions to work with virtual team members

6. Control Resources:

    Ensure that the physical resources assigned and allocated to the project are available as planned
    
    Monitor the planned versus actual utilization of resources
    
    Take corrective action, as necessary.

# Week 8 IT Project Risk: Tools, Techniques #

## 1. Risk ##

- General meaning -- “the possibility of loss or injury”
- Project risk is an uncertainty that can have a negative or positive effect on meeting project objectives

## 1.1. Best Practice…benefits ##

- Bridging the strategy and tactics gap to ensure that project delivery is tied to organizational needs and vision
- Focusing projects on the benefits they exist to support, rather than producing a setof deliverables
- Managing opportunities proactively as an integral part of business processes at bothstrategic and tactical levels
- Providing useful information to decision makers at all levels when the environmentis uncertain
- Allowing an appropriate level of risk to be taken intelligently with full awareness of the degree of uncertainty and its potential effects on objectives*

## 1.2. Negative & Positive Risk ##

- Negative risks: potential problems that might occur in the project and how they might obstruct project success
- Positive risks: risks that result in good things happening; sometimes called opportunities

## 2. Project Risk Management Processes ##

- Planning risk management : Deciding how to approach and plan the risk management activities for the project
- Identifying risks: Determining which risks are likely to affect a project and documenting the characteristics of each
- Performing qualitative risk analysis: Prioritizing risks based on their probability and impact of occurrence
- Performing quantitative risk analysis: Numerically estimating the effects of risks on project objectives
- Planning risk responses: Taking steps to enhance opportunities and reduce threats to meeting project objectives
- Controlling risk: Monitoring identified and residual risks, identifying new risks, carrying out risk response plans, and evaluating the effectiveness of risk strategies throughout the life of the project

## 2.1. Risks Planning many include ##

- Contingency plans are predefined actions that the project team will take if an identified risk event occurs.
- Fallback plans are developed for risks that have a high impact on meeting project objectives and are put into effect if attempts to reduce the risk do not work.
- Contingency reserves or contingency allowances are funds included in the cost baseline that can be used to mitigate cost or schedule overruns if known risks occur.
- Management reserves are funds held for unknown risks that are used for management control purposes. They are not part of the cost baseline

## 2.2 Categories of Risk ##

Following are some categories of IT project risks.

- Market risk:
- Financial risk
- Technology risk
- People risk
- Structure/process risk

## 2.3. Risks Identification ##

- Identifying risks is the process of understanding what potential events might hurt or enhance a particular project
- The aims of this phase is to identify , classify and prioritizing the organization’s information assets ( Know ourselves) and identify all important types and sources of risk and uncertainty (know our enemy), associated with each of the investment objectives.
- This is a crucial phase. If a risk is not identified it cannot be evaluated and managed
- Risk identification tools and techniques include:
  - Brainstorming
  - The Delphi Technique
  - Interviewing
  - SWOT analysis

## 2.4 What is Risk Assessment ? ##

- Assessing risk is the process of determining the likelihood of the threat being exercised against the vulnerability and the resulting impact from a successful compromise , i.e determine the relative risk for each of the vulnerabilities
- Risk assessment assigns a risk rating or score to each specific information asset, useful in evaluating the relative risk and making comparative ratings later in the risk control process
- Although all elements of the risk management cycle are important, risk assessments provide the foundation for other   elements of the cycle. In particular, risk assessments provide a basis for establishing appropriate policies and selecting cost-effective techniques to implement these policies

## 2.5 Methods of Risk Assessment ##

There are various methods assessing risk, including:

First : Quantitative risk assessment:
generally estimates values of Information Systems components as information, systems, business processes, recovery costs, etc.,
risk can be measured in terms of direct and indirect costs , based on:
(1) the likelihood that a damaging event will occur
(2) the costs of potential losses
(3) the costs of mitigating actions that could be taken.

Second : Qualitative risk assessment:
This approach can be taken by defining

- Risk in more subjective and general terms such as high, medium, and low.
- In this regard, qualitative assessments depend more on the expertise, experience, and judgment of those conducting the assessment.
- Qualitative risk assessments typically give risk results of “High”, “Moderate” and “Low”. However, by providing the impact and likelihood definition tables and the description of the impact, it is possible to adequately communicate the assessment to the organization’s management.

## 2.6 Risk Analysis ##

- Sensitivity analysis. It helps to determine which risks have the most potential impact on the project.

## 2.7 Risk Register ##

- A risk register is:
  - A document that contains the results of various risk management processes and that is often displayed in a table or spreadsheet format
  - A tool for documenting potential risk events and related information

Risk Register – Contents:

1. An identification number for each risk event
2. A rank for each risk event
3. The name of each risk event
4. A description of each risk event
5. The category under which each risk event falls
6. The root cause of each risk
7. Potential responses to each risk
8. The risk owner or person who will own or take responsibility for each risk
9. The probability and impact of each risk occurring.
10. The status of each risk

## 2.8 Planning Risk Responses ##

- Involves selection of control strategies, justification of strategies to upper management, and implementation/monitoring/on going assessment of adopted controls. The five basic response strategies for negative risks are as follows:
  - Risk avoidance or eliminating a specific threat, usually by eliminating its causes. Of course, not all risks can be eliminated, but specific risk events can be.
  - Risk acceptance or accepting the consequences if a risk occurs.
  - Risk transference or shifting the consequence of a risk and responsibility for its management to a third party.
  - Risk mitigation or reducing the impact of a risk event by reducing the probability of its occurrence.
  - Risk escalation or notifying a higher level authority. If the risk is outside of the scope of the project or the proposed response is outside of the project manager’s authority, it would make sense to escalate the risk to a higher-level manager within the organization.
- The five basic response strategies for positive risks are as follows:
  - Risk exploitation or doing whatever you can to make sure the positive risk happens.
  - Risk sharing or allocating ownership of the risk to another party.
  - Risk enhancement or changing the size of the opportunity by identifying and maximizing key drivers of the positive risk.
  - Risk acceptance also applies to positive risks when the project team does not take any actions toward a risk.
  - Risk escalation or notifying a higher level authority also applies to positive risks.

## 2.9 Risk Response Strategies ##

- Response strategies for negative risks:
  - Risk avoidance or eliminating a specific threat, usually by eliminating its causes
  - Risk acceptance or accepting the consequences should a risk occur.
  - Risk transference or shifting the consequence of a risk and responsibility for its management to a third party.
  - Risk mitigation or reducing the impact of a risk event by reducing the probability of its occurrence.
- Response strategies for positive risks:
  - Risk exploitation involves doing whatever you can to make sure the positive risk happens.
  - Risk sharing involves allocating ownership of the risk to another party
  - Risk enhancement involves changing the size of the opportunity by identifying and maximizing key drivers of the positive risk.
  - Risk acceptance applies to positive risks when the project team cannot or chooses not to take any actions toward a risk.

## 2.10 Residual and Secondary Risks ##

- Residual risks are risks that remain after all of the response strategies have been implemented
- Secondary risks are a direct result of implementing a risk response

## 2.11 Risk control ##

- Monitoring risks involves ensuring the appropriate risk responses are performed,
  - tracking identified risks,
  - identifying and analyzing new risk, and evaluating the effectiveness of risk management throughout the entire project.
  - Project risk management does not stop with the initial risk analysis.
- Identified risks may not materialize, or their probabilities of occurrence or loss may diminish.
- Previously identified risks may be determined to have a greater probability of occurrence or a higher estimated loss value.
- Similarly, new risks will be identified as the project progresses.
- Newly identified risks need to go through the same process as those identified during the initial risk assessment.
- A redistribution of resources devoted to risk management may be necessary because of relative changes in risk exposure.

Class QuiZ

- Q1: Who monitors individual risk?
- Q2: Who is responsible for managing project risks?
- Q3: How many risks you need to identify for your project? Why?
- Q4 (a): How to present (the best way to deal with) risk in your project proposal?
- Q4 (b): What is the objective of discussing risks in the project proposal?

A1: Individual risk is typically monitored by the person or entity directly involved or affected by the risk. In a professional context, individuals may monitor their own risks as part of their personal risk management strategy, or it may be the responsibility of their supervisors or managers to oversee individual risks.

A2: The responsibility for managing project risks usually falls on the project manager. The project manager is responsible for identifying potential risks, assessing their potential impact on the project, developing risk mitigation strategies, and implementing risk management processes throughout the project lifecycle.

A3: The number of risks to be identified for a project can vary depending on the nature, size, and complexity of the project. It is generally recommended to identify as many risks as possible to ensure comprehensive risk management. This helps in assessing the potential threats and opportunities that may arise during the project, allowing the project team to develop appropriate strategies to address them.

A4 (a): When presenting risk in a project proposal, it is important to provide a clear and concise description of the identified risks. This includes outlining the potential impact of each risk on the project's objectives, timeline, budget, and stakeholders. It is helpful to categorize risks based on their likelihood and severity, and provide a brief explanation of the proposed risk mitigation strategies.

A4 (b): The objective of discussing risks in a project proposal is to demonstrate a proactive and realistic approach to project management. By addressing risks upfront, the proposal shows that the project team has considered potential obstacles and has plans in place to mitigate or manage them. It provides transparency to stakeholders, instills confidence in the project's feasibility and success, and allows for better decision-making and resource allocation. Additionally, discussing risks can also help in identifying any gaps in the project plan or potential areas of improvement before the project is initiated.

## 2. Contracts ##

- A contract is a mutually binding agreement that obligates the seller to provide the specified products or services and obligates the buyer to pay for them.
- Contracts are legally binding, there is more accountability for delivering the work as stated in the contract.

### 2.1 Types of Contracts ###

Different types of contracts can be used in different situations:

- **Fixed price or lump sum contracts**: Involve a fixed total price for a well-defined product or service
- **Cost reimbursable contracts**: Involve payment to the seller for direct and indirect costs
- **Time and material contracts**: Hybrid of both fixed price and cost reimbursable contracts, often used by consultants
- **Unit price contracts**: Require the buyer to pay the seller a predetermined amount per unit of service

A single contract can include all four of these categories, if it makes sense for that procurement

### 2.2 Contract Types versus Risk ###

**high <----------Buyer's Risk----------> low**
Cost plus percentage of costs (CPPC) <---> Cost plus fixed fee (CPFF) <---> Cost plus incentive fee (CPIF) <---> Cost plus award fee (CPAF) <--->  Fixed-price incentive fee (FPIF) <---> Fixed-price economic price adjustment (FP-EPA) <---> Firm fixed price (FFP)
**low <----------Seller's Risk----------> high**

## 3. Tools and Techniques for Project Procurement Management ##

- Make or buy analysis
- Expert judgment
- Market research

### 4. Procurement Management Plan ###

The following are some of the items that might be included in a procurement management plan:

- Guidelines for types of contracts to be used in different situations
- Standard procurement documents or templates to be used, if applicable
- Guidelines for creating contract work breakdown structures, statements of work, and other procurement documents
- Roles and responsibilities of the project team and related departments, such as the purchasing or legal department
- Guidelines for using independent estimates to evaluate sellers
- Suggestions for managing multiple providers
- Processes for coordinating procurement decisions with other project areas, such as scheduling and performance reporting
- Constraints and assumptions related to purchases and acquisitions
- Lead times for purchases and acquisitions
- Risk mitigation strategies for purchases and acquisitions, such as  insurance contracts and bonds
- Guidelines for identifying prequalified sellers and organizational lists of preferred sellers
- Procurement metrics to assist in evaluating sellers and managing contracts

### 5. Contract Statement of Work ###

- A statement of work (SOW) is a description of the work required for the procurement.
- If a SOW is used as part of a contract to describe only the work required for that particular contract, it is called a contract statement of work

### 6. Procurement Documents ###

- Request for Proposals: Used to solicit proposals from prospective sellers
  - A proposal is a document prepared by a seller when there are different approaches for meeting buyer needs
- Requests for Quotes: Used to solicit quotes or bids from prospective suppliers
  - A bid, also called a tender or quote (short for quotation), is a document prepared by sellers providing pricing for standard items that have been clearly defined by the buyer

### 7. Source Selection Criteria ###

It’s important to prepare some form of evaluation criteria, preferably before issuing a formal RFP or RFQ.
Some possible source selection criteria are:
&radic; Understanding of need
&radic; Overall or life-cycle cost
&radic; Technical capability
&radic; Risk
&radic; Management approach
&radic; Technical approach
&radic; Warranty
&radic; Financial capacity
&radic; Production capacity and interest
&radic; Business size and type
&radic; Past performance of sellers
&radic; References

## 8. Seller Selection ##

- Organizations often do an initial evaluation of all proposals and bids and then develop a short list of potential sellers for further evaluation
- Sellers on the short list often prepare the best and final offer (BAFO)
- Finally, contract signed by the buyer and the selected seller

## 9. Controlling Procurements ##

- Changes to any part of the project need to be reviewed, approved, and documented by the same people in the same way they approved the original part of the plan.
- Evaluation of any change should include an impact analysis. How will the change affect the scope, time, cost, and quality of the goods or services being provided? There must also be a baseline to understand and analyze changes.
- Changes must be documented in writing. Project team members should document all important meetings and telephone calls.
- When procuring complex information systems, project managers and their teams must stay closely involved to make sure the new system will meet business needs and work in an operational environment. Do not assume that everything will go well because you hired a reputable supplier. The buying organization needs to provide expertise as well.
- Have backup plans in case the new system does not work as planned.
- Several tools and techniques can help in contract administration, such as a formal contract change control system, buyer-conducted procurement performance reviews, inspections and audits, performance reporting, payment systems, claims administration, and records management systems.

## 10. Using Software to Assist in Project Procurement Management ##

- Web-based ERP (Electronic Resource Planning): Creating and approving purchasing requisitions, placing purchase orders, and receiving goods and services by using a software system based on Internet technology.
- E-MRO (Maintenance, Repair, and Overhaul): The same as web-based ERP, except that the goods and services ordered are MRO supplies that are not related to a particular product.
- E-sourcing: Identifying new suppliers for a specific category of purchasing requirements using Internet technology.
- E-tendering: Sending requests for information and prices to suppliers and receiving the responses of suppliers using Internet technology.
- E-reverse auctioning: Using Internet technology to buy goods and services from a number of known or unknown suppliers.
- E-informing: Gathering and distributing purchasing information with internal and external parties using Internet technology.
- E-market sites: Expands on web-based ERP to open up value chains. Buying communities can access preferred suppliers’ products and services, add to shopping carts, create requisitions, seek approval, receive purchase orders, and process electronic invoices with integration to suppliers’ supply chains and buyers’ financial systems.

# Week 10 IT Project Leadership, Governance and Alignment #

## 1.Project Leadership ##

- Project leadership, most simply, is the act of leading a team towards the successful completion of a project.
- But of course, it is much more than that.
- It’s about getting something done well through others.
- Or it’s about “placing more emphasis on people.”

## 1.1 Why is Project Leadership Important? ##

- Projects often fall short of achieving their anticipated results, not due to a lack of project management, but rather from a lack of project leadership.
- Because project success is a direct reflection of the project manager, it is his/her responsibility not just to manage the details and report status of a project, but to go beyond and add value through providing leadership.
- Leadership is important through all phases of the project life cycle.
- Good planning, followed by flawless execution, is critical to achieve the highest degree of project success.
- Effective project managers acquire a balance of technical, interpersonal, and conceptual skills that help them analyze situations and interact appropriately.
- The appropriate use of following interpersonal skills assists the project manager in effectively managing the project:
  - **Leadingship**
  - Team building
  - Motivation
  - **Communication**
  - Influencing
  - Decision Making
  - Political and cultural awareness
  - Negotiation
  - Trust building
  - Conflict management
  - Coaching

## 1.2 Leader vs. Manager ##

|| **Leader** | **Manager** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Style | Transformational | Transactional |
| Essence | Change | Stability |
| Focus | People | Work |
| Approach | Sets direction | Plans details |
| Horizon | Long-term | Short-term |
| Has | Followers | Subordinates |
| Seeks | Vision | Objectives |
| Decisions | Facilitates | Makes |
| Culture | Shapes | Enacts |
| Motivation | Achievements | Results |
| Risk | Takes | Minimizes |
| Rules | Breaks | Makes |

**How great leaders inspire action?**:

- Admiral McRaven
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBuIGBCF9jc>
- Steve Jobs
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tuw8hxrFBH8>
- Simon Sinek
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp0HIF3SfI4>

**Q: As a project leader, do you agree or disagree with the following practices?**

- “Don’t wait for top management support.” Agree or disagree?
  - Agree, with caveats.
  - Explanation: It is generally beneficial for project leaders to be proactive and take ownership of their projects. Waiting for top management support indefinitely may cause delays and hinder progress. However, it is important to note that seeking support and involving top management at appropriate stages is crucial for aligning goals, securing resources, and managing potential risks. Balancing autonomy and collaboration is key.
- “Share the credit, not the blame.” Agree or disagree?
  - Agree.
  - Explanation: In a collaborative work environment, it is important to foster a culture of recognition and fairness. Sharing credit with team members promotes motivation, trust, and a sense of ownership. It encourages collaboration and boosts morale. Conversely, blaming individuals may lead to a toxic work environment, hamper teamwork, and discourage risk-taking and innovation. However, it's also important to identify and learn from mistakes collectively, without assigning blame.
- “Focus on the execution, not the result”. Agree or disagree?
  - Disagree, with nuances.
  - Explanation: While execution is crucial for project success, focusing solely on execution without considering the desired results can lead to inefficiency and misalignment. A project's success depends on both the process and the outcome. A balanced approach involves defining clear goals, monitoring progress, adapting as necessary, and continuously evaluating the results to ensure that the execution is driving the desired outcomes.
- “Add values by doing”. Agree or disagree?
  - Agree.
  - Explanation: Taking action and actively contributing to a project is generally seen as valuable. It is through actions and tangible results that progress is made and value is created. Merely talking or planning without execution can lead to stagnation. However, it's important to ensure that the actions align with the project's goals and are carried out with proper planning, coordination, and consideration of potential risks and constraints.

## 1.3 Five Practices of Exemplary Leadership ##

- Inspire a Shared Vision - imagined an exciting, highly attractive future for their organizations.
- Challenge the Process - involved a change from the status quo.
- Enable Others to Act- It requires group collaboration and individual accountability
- Encourage the Heart - people often become exhausted, frustrated and disappointed. They are often tempted to give up. They need acknowledgment.

## 1.4 Leadership Styles ##

## 2. Project Communication ##

### 2.1 Why is Project Communication Important? ###

- IT Project Manager’s top skill ?
- Communication plays a greater role in IT project success
- IT professionals must be able to communicate effectively to succeed in their positions

### 2.2 Project Communication Management Processes ###

- **Planning communications management:** Determining the information and communications needs of the stakeholders
- **Managing communications:** Creating, distributing, storing, retrieving, and disposing of project communications based on the communications management plan
- **Controlling communications:** Monitoring and controlling project communications to ensure that stakeholder communication needs are met

### 2.3 Key to Good Communication ###

- Project managers spend as much as 90 percent of their time in communication
- Focus on group and individual communication needs
- Use formal and informal methods for communication
- Distribute important information in an effective and timely manner
- Communicate bad news in good ways
- Determine the number of communication channels

### 2.4 Importance of Face-to-Face Communication ###

- Research says that in a face-to-face interaction:
  - 58 percent of communication is through body language.
  - 35 percent of communication is through how the words are said
  - 7 percent of communication is through the content or words that are spoken
- Pay attention to more than just the actual words someone is saying.

### 2.5 Distributing Information and Communication ###

- Don’t bury crucial information
- Don’t be afraid to report bad information
- Oral communication via meetings and informal talks helps bring important information

**Example of Written Communication (email)** -- Steve Jobs Knew How to Write an Email. Here's How He Did It
James,
Our proposal does set the upper limit for ebook retail pricing based on the hardcover price of each book. The reason we are doing this is that, with our experience selling a lot of content online, we simply don't think the ebook market can be successful with pricing higher than $12.99$ or $14.99$. Heck, Amazon is selling these books at $9.99$, and who knows, maybe they are right and we will fail even at $12.99. But we're willing to try at the prices we've proposed. We are not willing to try at higher prices because we are pretty sure we'll all fail.
As I see it, HC has the following choices:

1. Throw in with Apple and see if we can all make a go of this to create a real mainstream ebooks market at $12.99$ and $14.99$.

2. Keep going with Amazon at $9.99$. You will make a bit more money in the short term, but in the medium term Amazon will tell you they will be paying you 70 percent of $9.99$. They have shareholders too.
3. Hold back your books from Amazon. Without a way for customers to buy your ebooks, they will steal them. This will be the start of piracy and once started there will be no stopping it. Trust me, I've seen this happen with my own eyes.

Maybe I'm missing something, but I don't see any other alternatives. Do you?

Regards,
Steve

Q1: What did you learn in terms of good email communication?
**Clear and concise:** The email gets straight to the point and expresses the main ideas clearly. Steve Jobs avoids unnecessary jargon or complex language, making the email easy to understand.

**Organized structure:** The email is structured with bullet points, presenting different choices or options. This helps the recipient to quickly grasp the key information and options available.

**Context and reasoning:** Steve Jobs provides context for the proposed pricing strategy and explains the reasoning behind it. By sharing insights from their experience and mentioning competitor pricing, he helps the recipient understand the rationale behind the proposed approach.

**Direct and assertive tone:** The email communicates a clear position and preference, showing confidence in the proposed strategy. Steve Jobs presents alternatives and expresses a willingness to take risks, but also emphasizes the potential risks of not following their suggested approach.

**Respectful and professional:** The email maintains a respectful tone, addressing the recipient by name and signing off with "Regards." Even though Steve Jobs expresses a strong opinion, the email does not come across as confrontational or disrespectful.

Q2: What did you learn in terms of poor email communication?

**Lack of personalization:** The email does not address the recipient's concerns or interests explicitly. It may be helpful to acknowledge the recipient's perspective or previous discussions to show empathy and build rapport.

**Limited formalities:** Although the email is generally professional, it could benefit from including a salutation at the beginning and a closing remark or thank you. These small touches can enhance the overall tone and make the communication feel more courteous.

**Emotional language:** While passion and conviction can be effective in communication, some of the language used, such as "we will all fail" and "they will steal them," can come across as overly emotional or fear-inducing. Balancing emotion with a calm and rational tone can lead to more constructive discussions.

**Absence of a clear call to action:** The email concludes with a question, but it could be more explicit in specifying the desired response or action from the recipient. Adding a clear call to action can help drive the conversation forward and facilitate a timely response.

### 2.6 Best Communications Best Outcomes! ###

- “Do it” – done in 3 weeks
- “Do it, please” – done in 2 weeks
- “Here is why it is so important...” here is how I would do it, but I trust you will choose the best way..., Would you do it please” – done in 1 day

### 2.7 Communicate, Communicate, Communicate ###

- Three groups have a personal interest in knowing project status:
  - Top management
  - The implementation team
  - Key users

- Q: How would you communicate with them?
- Q: Which medium of communication to use?
- Q: What type of communication to strategy to use: formal, informal?

## 3. Governance: concept and imortance ##

### 3.1 What is Governance? ###

- Governance is the framework of authority and accountability that defines and controls the outputs, outcomes and benefits from projects, programmes and portfolios.
- Governance provides confidence to the board of directors/trustees that investments in projects, programmes and portfolios are being well managed.
- Governance empowers project professionals to execute their responsibilities by defining delegated limits of authority and establishing effective escalation routes for issues and change requests.

### 3.2 IT Governance ###

- IT governance provides a structure for aligning IT strategy with business strategy. By following a formal framework, organizations can produce measurable results toward achieving their strategies and goals. A formal program also takes stakeholders' interests into account, as well as the needs of staff and the processes they follow.
- Both public- and private-sector organizations need a way to ensure that their IT functions support business strategies and objectives. And a formal IT governance program should be on the radar of any organization in any industry that needs to comply with regulations related to financial and technological accountability.

### 3.3 Project Governance ###

- Project governance is aligned with the organization’s governance model and that encompasses the project life cycle.
- Project governance provides direction and defines decision-making procedures and metrics for validating impacts to the project.
- It provides a vehicle for information gathering and reporting to all stakeholders.
- Project governance framework provides the project manager and team with structure, processes, decision-making models and tools for managing the project, while supporting and controlling the project for successful delivery.
- Project governance is a critical element of any project, especially on complex and risky projects.
- It provides a comprehensive, consistent method of controlling the project and ensuring its success by defining and documenting and communicating reliable, repeatable project practices.

Project governance involves stakeholders as well as documented policies, procedures, standards; responsibilities; and authorities. Examples of the elements of a project governance framework include:

- Project success and deliverable acceptance criteria;
- Process to identify, escalate, and resolve issues that arise during the project
- Relationship among the project team, organizational groups, and external stakeholders;
- Project organization chart that identifies project roles;
- Processes and procedures for the communication of information;
- Project decision-making processes;
- Guidelines for aligning project governance and organizational strategy;
- Project life cycle approach;
- Process for stage gate or phase reviews;
- Process for review and approval for changes to budget, scope, quality, and schedule which are beyond the authority of the project manager; and
- Process to align internal stakeholders with project process requirements.

While project governance is the framework in which the project team performs, the team is still responsible for planning, executing, controlling, and closing the project.

Q: As a project team, where would you describe the project governance approach?
**Project Charter**: The project charter outlines the project's purpose, objectives, scope, stakeholders, and high-level governance structure. It defines the project sponsor, project manager, and other key roles, along with their authority and responsibilities.

**Organizational Structure**: The project governance approach clarifies how the project team is structured within the larger organizational context. It defines reporting lines, establishes project committees or steering groups, and outlines decision-making processes.

**Decision-Making Authority**: The governance approach specifies who has the authority to make decisions at different levels of the project. It defines the escalation process for issues or risks that require higher-level decision-making or involvement.

**Communication and Reporting**: The governance approach determines the communication channels and reporting mechanisms within the project team and with external stakeholders. It defines the frequency, format, and content of project status updates, progress reports, and key milestone communications.

**Risk Management**: The governance approach includes the processes and procedures for identifying, assessing, mitigating, and monitoring risks throughout the project lifecycle. It defines the roles and responsibilities for risk management and the escalation process for significant risks.

**Change Management**: The governance approach outlines how changes to project scope, objectives, or requirements are managed. It includes the change control process, which defines how changes are assessed, approved, implemented, and communicated.

**Quality Assurance**: The governance approach establishes the processes for ensuring the quality of project deliverables and adherence to defined standards. It includes quality control measures, quality assurance roles and responsibilities, and procedures for conducting reviews and audits.

**Performance Measurement and Evaluation**: The governance approach defines the metrics and key performance indicators (KPIs) used to monitor project progress and assess success. It outlines the processes for tracking and reporting on project performance against these metrics.

**Stakeholder Engagement**: The governance approach includes strategies for engaging and managing project stakeholders. It identifies the key stakeholders, their interests, and the methods for involving them in decision-making and ensuring their needs are considered.

Q: As a project team, where would you describe the project governance approach?

A: **Governance Structure**: It defines the roles and responsibilities of project stakeholders, such as the project sponsor, project manager, steering committee, and other key individuals or groups involved in decision-making and oversight.

**Decision-Making Processes**: The plan outlines the decision-making authority and processes within the project. It specifies how decisions will be made, who will be responsible for them, and how they will be communicated to the relevant parties.

**Communication and Reporting**: The plan describes the communication channels, frequency, and methods to be used for effective project communication. It outlines the reporting requirements and formats, including status updates, progress reports, and any specific communication needs of different stakeholders.

**Risk Management**: The plan outlines the risk management approach for identifying, assessing, mitigating, and monitoring risks throughout the project. It defines the roles and responsibilities of individuals involved in risk management, as well as the procedures for escalation and reporting of risks.

**Change Management**: This section of the plan addresses how changes to project scope, requirements, or objectives will be managed. It defines the change control process, including how changes are requested, assessed, approved, and implemented.

**Quality Assurance**: The plan describes the quality assurance processes and practices that will be followed to ensure project deliverables meet the defined quality standards. It may include quality control measures, quality assurance roles and responsibilities, and methods for conducting audits or reviews.

**Performance Measurement**: This section outlines the metrics, key performance indicators (KPIs), or other measurement criteria that will be used to evaluate the project's progress and success. It defines how performance will be tracked, reported, and used to inform decision-making.

**Stakeholder Engagement**: The plan addresses how stakeholders will be identified, engaged, and managed throughout the project. It defines strategies for effective stakeholder communication, involvement, and satisfaction measurement.
