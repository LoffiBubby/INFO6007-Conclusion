# Week 10 IT Project Leadership, Governance and Alignment #

## 1.Project Leadership ##

- Project leadership, most simply, is the act of leading a team towards the successful completion of a project.
- But of course, it is much more than that.
- It’s about getting something done well through others.
- Or it’s about “placing more emphasis on people.”

## 1.1 Why is Project Leadership Important? ##

- Projects often fall short of achieving their anticipated results, not due to a lack of project management, but rather from a lack of project leadership.
- Because project success is a direct reflection of the project manager, it is his/her responsibility not just to manage the details and report status of a project, but to go beyond and add value through providing leadership.
- Leadership is important through all phases of the project life cycle.
- Good planning, followed by flawless execution, is critical to achieve the highest degree of project success.
- Effective project managers acquire a balance of technical, interpersonal, and conceptual skills that help them analyze situations and interact appropriately.
- The appropriate use of following interpersonal skills assists the project manager in effectively managing the project:
  - **Leadingship**
  - Team building
  - Motivation
  - **Communication**
  - Influencing
  - Decision Making
  - Political and cultural awareness
  - Negotiation
  - Trust building
  - Conflict management
  - Coaching

**Q: As a project leader, do you agree or disagree with the following practices?**

- “Don’t wait for top management support.” Agree or disagree?
  - Agree, with caveats.
  - Explanation: It is generally beneficial for project leaders to be proactive and take ownership of their projects. Waiting for top management support indefinitely may cause delays and hinder progress. However, it is important to note that seeking support and involving top management at appropriate stages is crucial for aligning goals, securing resources, and managing potential risks. Balancing autonomy and collaboration is key.
- “Share the credit, not the blame.” Agree or disagree?
  - Agree.
  - Explanation: In a collaborative work environment, it is important to foster a culture of recognition and fairness. Sharing credit with team members promotes motivation, trust, and a sense of ownership. It encourages collaboration and boosts morale. Conversely, blaming individuals may lead to a toxic work environment, hamper teamwork, and discourage risk-taking and innovation. However, it's also important to identify and learn from mistakes collectively, without assigning blame.
- “Focus on the execution, not the result”. Agree or disagree?
  - Disagree, with nuances.
  - Explanation: While execution is crucial for project success, focusing solely on execution without considering the desired results can lead to inefficiency and misalignment. A project's success depends on both the process and the outcome. A balanced approach involves defining clear goals, monitoring progress, adapting as necessary, and continuously evaluating the results to ensure that the execution is driving the desired outcomes.
- “Add values by doing”. Agree or disagree?
  - Agree.
  - Explanation: Taking action and actively contributing to a project is generally seen as valuable. It is through actions and tangible results that progress is made and value is created. Merely talking or planning without execution can lead to stagnation. However, it's important to ensure that the actions align with the project's goals and are carried out with proper planning, coordination, and consideration of potential risks and constraints.

## 2. Project Communication ##

### 2.1 Why is Project Communication Important? ###

- IT Project Manager’s top skill ?
- Communication plays a greater role in IT project success
- IT professionals must be able to communicate effectively to succeed in their positions

### 2.2 Project Communication Management Processes ###

- **Planning communications management:** Determining the information and communications needs of the stakeholders
- **Managing communications:** Creating, distributing, storing, retrieving, and disposing of project communications based on the communications management plan
- **Controlling communications:** Monitoring and controlling project communications to ensure that stakeholder communication needs are met

- Focus on group and individual communication needs
- Use formal and informal methods for communication
- Distribute important information in an effective and timely manner
- Communicate bad news in good ways
- Determine the number of communication channels

### 2.4 Importance of Face-to-Face Communication ###

  - 58 percent of communication is through body language.
  - 35 percent of communication is through how the words are said
  - 7 percent of communication is through the content or words that are spoken

### 2.5 Distributing Information and Communication ###

- Don’t bury crucial information
- Don’t be afraid to report bad information
- Oral communication via meetings and informal talks helps bring important information

**Example of Written Communication (email)** -- Steve Jobs Knew How to Write an Email. Here's How He Did It
James,
Our proposal does set the upper limit for ebook retail pricing based on the hardcover price of each book. The reason we are doing this is that, with our experience selling a lot of content online, we simply don't think the ebook market can be successful with pricing higher than $12.99$ or $14.99$. Heck, Amazon is selling these books at $9.99$, and who knows, maybe they are right and we will fail even at $12.99. But we're willing to try at the prices we've proposed. We are not willing to try at higher prices because we are pretty sure we'll all fail.
As I see it, HC has the following choices:

1. Throw in with Apple and see if we can all make a go of this to create a real mainstream ebooks market at $12.99$ and $14.99$.

2. Keep going with Amazon at $9.99$. You will make a bit more money in the short term, but in the medium term Amazon will tell you they will be paying you 70 percent of $9.99$. They have shareholders too.
3. Hold back your books from Amazon. Without a way for customers to buy your ebooks, they will steal them. This will be the start of piracy and once started there will be no stopping it. Trust me, I've seen this happen with my own eyes.

Maybe I'm missing something, but I don't see any other alternatives. Do you?

Regards,
Steve

Q1: What did you learn in terms of good email communication?
**Clear and concise:** The email gets straight to the point and expresses the main ideas clearly. Steve Jobs avoids unnecessary jargon or complex language, making the email easy to understand.

**Organized structure:** The email is structured with bullet points, presenting different choices or options. This helps the recipient to quickly grasp the key information and options available.

**Context and reasoning:** Steve Jobs provides context for the proposed pricing strategy and explains the reasoning behind it. By sharing insights from their experience and mentioning competitor pricing, he helps the recipient understand the rationale behind the proposed approach.

**Direct and assertive tone:** The email communicates a clear position and preference, showing confidence in the proposed strategy. Steve Jobs presents alternatives and expresses a willingness to take risks, but also emphasizes the potential risks of not following their suggested approach.

**Respectful and professional:** The email maintains a respectful tone, addressing the recipient by name and signing off with "Regards." Even though Steve Jobs expresses a strong opinion, the email does not come across as confrontational or disrespectful.

Q2: What did you learn in terms of poor email communication?

**Lack of personalization:** The email does not address the recipient's concerns or interests explicitly. It may be helpful to acknowledge the recipient's perspective or previous discussions to show empathy and build rapport.

**Limited formalities:** Although the email is generally professional, it could benefit from including a salutation at the beginning and a closing remark or thank you. These small touches can enhance the overall tone and make the communication feel more courteous.

**Emotional language:** While passion and conviction can be effective in communication, some of the language used, such as "we will all fail" and "they will steal them," can come across as overly emotional or fear-inducing. Balancing emotion with a calm and rational tone can lead to more constructive discussions.

**Absence of a clear call to action:** The email concludes with a question, but it could be more explicit in specifying the desired response or action from the recipient. Adding a clear call to action can help drive the conversation forward and facilitate a timely response.

### 2.6 Best Communications Best Outcomes! ###

- “Do it” – done in 3 weeks
- “Do it, please” – done in 2 weeks
- “Here is why it is so important...” here is how I would do it, but I trust you will choose the best way..., Would you do it please” – done in 1 day

### 2.7 Communicate, Communicate, Communicate ###

- Three groups have a personal interest in knowing project status:
  - Top management
  - The implementation team
  - Key users

- Q: How would you communicate with them?
- Q: Which medium of communication to use?
- Q: What type of communication to strategy to use: formal, informal?

## 3. Governance: concept and imortance ##

### 3.1 What is Governance? ###

- Governance is the framework of authority and accountability that defines and controls the outputs, outcomes and benefits from projects, programmes and portfolios.
- Governance provides confidence to the board of directors/trustees that investments in projects, programmes and portfolios are being well managed.
- Governance empowers project professionals to execute their responsibilities by defining delegated limits of authority and establishing effective escalation routes for issues and change requests.

### 3.2 IT Governance ###

- IT governance provides a structure for aligning IT strategy with business strategy. By following a formal framework, organizations can produce measurable results toward achieving their strategies and goals. A formal program also takes stakeholders' interests into account, as well as the needs of staff and the processes they follow.
- Both public- and private-sector organizations need a way to ensure that their IT functions support business strategies and objectives. And a formal IT governance program should be on the radar of any organization in any industry that needs to comply with regulations related to financial and technological accountability.

### 3.3 Project Governance ###

- Project governance is aligned with the organization’s governance model and that encompasses the project life cycle.
- Project governance provides direction and defines decision-making procedures and metrics for validating impacts to the project.
- It provides a vehicle for information gathering and reporting to all stakeholders.
- Project governance framework provides the project manager and team with structure, processes, decision-making models and tools for managing the project, while supporting and controlling the project for successful delivery.
- Project governance is a critical element of any project, especially on complex and risky projects.
- It provides a comprehensive, consistent method of controlling the project and ensuring its success by defining and documenting and communicating reliable, repeatable project practices.

Project governance involves stakeholders as well as documented policies, procedures, standards; responsibilities; and authorities. Examples of the elements of a project governance framework include:

- Project success and deliverable acceptance criteria;
- Process to identify, escalate, and resolve issues that arise during the project
- Relationship among the project team, organizational groups, and external stakeholders;
- Project organization chart that identifies project roles;
- Processes and procedures for the communication of information;
- Project decision-making processes;
- Guidelines for aligning project governance and organizational strategy;
- Project life cycle approach;
- Process for stage gate or phase reviews;
- Process for review and approval for changes to budget, scope, quality, and schedule which are beyond the authority of the project manager; and
- Process to align internal stakeholders with project process requirements.

While project governance is the framework in which the project team performs, the team is still responsible for planning, executing, controlling, and closing the project.
